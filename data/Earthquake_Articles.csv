No. 899. BERLIN King Edward and Queen Alexandra will be possess ed of more than human energy if they manage to carry out in full the extensive programme which is being mapped out for them on all sides. New suggestions as to what the King and Queen will undertake while in Berlin are continually being thrown out, the pro gramme thus foreshadowed amounting, all in all, to far more than the King, with the best inten tions, could manage in a three days’ visit. There is an interesting rumour to the effect that the British Embassy may make a special effort to arrange for a function of some sort at which the English people in Berlin may see something of the King, apart from the German festivities! 1 It must be emphasised, however, that this is a mere rumour. It is at any rate definitely known that the Embassy would be delighted to make some such arrangement if possible. But the extreme brevity of the King’s time in Berlin, and the extreme demands which his German hosts are likely to make upon it may easily make an exclusively English reunion out of the ques tion. It is now definitely fixed that the King’s arrival will take place at the Lehrter Bahnhof, at about midday on Tuesday, February 9. As usual the “Defiliercour” at the Imperial Pa lace on Wednesday night was a scene of brilliance and magnificence not easily to be imagined by any one unfamiliar with the pomp of the Prussian Court. The Kaiser, in the uniform of the Red Hussars, and the Kaiserin, in rich red velvet embroidered i|n gold, stood throughout the lengthy ceremony, each a little to the side of the red, high-backed chairs which, mounted on a podium, served as thrones. Be hind the Kaiser stood the royal princes, while the Kaiserin was similarly supported by a dazzlingly gowned group of princesses. In all, six hundred persons did homage to the Emperor and Empress during the evening. An American debutante was Frau von Werner, wife of Oberst-Leutnant von Werner, Adjutant to prince Carl of Hohenzollern. Frau von Werner is a daughter of General von Steinwehr, one of the noted officers of th<e American Civil War, whose remains rest beside those of President Garfield, a place of honour which was specially assigned to them as a mark of national gratitude. Frau von Werner was, of course, presented as a member of Court society, and not as a member of the American diplomatic party. She wore a gown of light helio trope liberty, with a Court train in a darker shade of velvet, embroidered with silver. Eleonora Duse, the famous Italian actress, com menced on Wednesday night another Berlin Gastspiel, appearing as Ella Rentheim in Ibsen’s “John Gabriel Borkman.” The appearance was not a success. Eleonora Duse, as an Italian, is unlikely to be a success in Berlin while she tries to show the Ger mans how Ibsen should be played. Although the great actress appeared in the small Kammerspiel house, the sitting accommodation showed gaps which were only too frequent. The Berlin dramatic cri tics point out that Duse’s southern individuality is totally unsuited to interpret the Northern characters of the Ibsen plays. Duse’s ensemble, moreover, was shockingly poor. Signor Dante Capelli, who struggled with the title role, John Gabriel JBorkman, had not the slightest idea of the real nature of its requirements. Duse is earnestly urged by the Berlin press to abandon = AMY HARE Concert Pianiete receives Pupils for Pianoforte, Harmony and Sight-reading Mommsen St. 69, Berlin-€harlottenburg. her “Ibsen experiments” and confine herself to the Italian roles in which she can always be certain of holding and fascinating Berlin. Winter sport in Oberhof and other centres is engrossing the' attention of many Berlin-Americans. Miss Idelle Morrison, a guest at Mrs. Bernard Goldsmith’s, has gone with a party of friends to Goslar for a week of winter spoit. Mrs. August Mickler and Miss Meta Mickler have gone to Oberhof to join a party of friends in South Germany for a week of outdoor life. Mr. and Mrs. Julius Ollesheimer, Joachimsthaler Strasse 8, return at the end of this week from Ober hof, where they have been staying since before the Christmas holidays. Prince and Princess Carl von Hohenzollern gave a musical soiree in their Berlin residence on Friday evening, January 16. The programme was given by Miss Marian Tiziano, a pupil of Mrs. MackenZjj.*- Wood, and by Signor Certani, a talented violinist. Miss Tiziano sang: — Obstination (Fontenailles), Nymphes et Sylvains (Bemberg), Si Mes Vers (Hahn), The Jewel Song from “Faust,” and added by request Tosti’s Serenata. Among the guests was Prinz Wilhelm von Preussen, third son of the late Prinz Albrecht, who is much interested in music, and who united with their royal highnesses in complimenting Mi^s Tiz'ano on her voice and singing. Mr. Arthur Nevin, the well known American com poser, and Mrs. Nevin expect to leave on February 1 for a two months’ trip to Italy and Egypt. Friends of Miss Helene Wickert, Hohenzollern Strasse 7, will be glad to know that she is on the rapid road to recovery from her recent illness. Miss Wickert has been under treatment at Dr. Unger’s Clinic, Derfflinger Strasse 20. Americans recently registered at Al. Peters’ Shipp ing Offices, Unter den Linden 6, include:— Mr. Geo. J. Loewy, of New York, at Hotel Belle vue ; Mrs. A. O. Whipple and Miss Josephine Whipple, of North Dakota, at Victoria Louisen Platz 10; C. G. Hoover, of Rochester, Indiana, at Martin Luther Strasse 11 (in Berlin until Apr.il 1); Dr. John F. Golden, of Chicago, at Hotel Bristol; Mr."" M. S. Salisian, of Utica, N.Y., at Hotel Central; Mr. H. P. Philibotian, of Syracuse, N.Y., at the Central Hotel. Frau Hauptmann Krag, who has been visiting her mother, Mrs. Hermann Schmidt, at Kurfursten- damm 10 since the Christmas holidays, has returned to her home in Thorn. Fire broke out in the chief Telegraph Office shortly after 12 o’clock on Thursday night owing to some defect in one of the cables. Firemen were promptly on the spot, and the fire was extinguished before 6erious damage had beeh done. A desperate effort to escape, by jumping out of a’train in motion as it was approaching Diihringshof on the Ost- bahn, was made by a prisoner on Thursday. The warder in charge of him, and a sailor belonging to the German cruiser “Roon,” immediately jumped out after the man and sustained severe injuries, but secured the prisoner again.

M. Rouanet then sharply criticised Russia’s polity in Persia. M. Pichon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, saijd that the loan would be taken up under constitutional guarantees. France had an interest in the strength of her ally, and wias supporting the Anglo-Russian policy in Persia. M. Rouanet’s resolution was rejected by a large majority. SERIOUS AFFRAY ON THE RAND.

Most of your readers are doubtless familiar with the extraordinary story centring around the Rev. Smyth Pigott, an unbeneficed clergyman of the Church of England, w'ho has conferred unenviable notoriety on the little hamlet of Spaxton, Somer set, by the amazing establishment he has founded there with the suggestive title of “The Abode of Love.” This individual is the successor of the un speakable Prince, an unfrocked clergyman, who many years ago created the Agapemonite sect and gathered around himself large numbers of weak-minded men and women. They were shut off from the world, living together in their own colony, and, iff all ac counts are to be credited, indulging in every species of debauchery under the cloak of religion. In due time Prince died, but his evil work was not allowed to rest. Smyth Pigott, who appears to be more brazen than his predecessor, assumed .the mantle and promptly announced himself as the “Messiah.” From a London suburb, where he and his foolish) followers first installed themselves, they w'ere driven by the righteous indignation of the inhabitants, subsequently finding refuge in a magnificent country mansion at Spaxton, which is within easy distance of Bridgewater. From time to time sensational rumours were circulated in the surrounding villages and duly reproduced in the press, but it was not until June, 1903, that the authorities awoke to a full realisation of the infamous proceedings carried on within the walls of the “Abode of Love,” as the building was named. At that time the’local registrar was called upon to register the birth of a child in the “Abode,” the parents being given as Smyth Pigott and a Miss Ruth Preece, a young woman who appears to have been attracted to the Agapemonites and become infatuated with the im poster himself. The registration ceremony was conducted with the greatest pomp, but the most amazing feature of this amazing event was the at tendance of Mrs. Smyth Pigott, the leader’s law ful wife, who not only appeared perfectly unmoved by the evidence of her husband’s unspeakable per fidy, but actually encouraged his hypocritical mode of life. Since then a second child has been born to the same parents, and at this juncture the Bishop of Bath and Wells, in whose diocese the “Abode” is situated, deemed it advisable to take proceedings against the man whose presence was fostering such widespread scandal. The trial took place on Wednes day (Jan. 20) in the Consistory Court of the Cathe dral at Wells, and resulted in the condemnation of the defendant in costs. Further drastic action is now expected from the Bishop, and it is sincerely to be hoped that the county, and indeed the country, will be made too hot for this impudent charlatan who seeks to disguise his evil courses under the c !°ak of sanctity. His career is itself a story of vicissitudes as remarkable as his present occupation. Starting as a sailor before the mast, he afterwards decided to enter the Church, went to Oxford, and was ultimately ordained. He served as a curate for some time and then drifted into the Salvation Army. He is said to be the possessor of a large fortune, all derived from the pockets of his de luded followers. H. G. B.

Several large villages were wiped out and many hundreds of jieople killed or injured. The news was first conveyed to Tetuan by refugees from the scene. THE CHOLERA IN ST. PETERSBURG.

San Francisco, January 22. he revival of the anti-Japanese agitation which found vent in the formulation of the legislative mea sures recently condemned by President Roosevelt and Governor Gillette, is now being manifested |in other directions. Several prominent newspapers are demanding the immediate return of the United States battleships to the Pacific Coast, w;hich is declared to be entirely unprotected against the Japanese at tack that is popularly believed to be probable. The same papers favourably comment on the statements contained m a document published by the Army General Staff with regard to the construction of fortifications at San Pedro harbour, near Los An geles. According to this document, a “certain Orien tal Power” could land 100,000 men on the Pacific Coast within a month, and increase this army to 300,000 by the end of two months. It is further stated that, once the enemy secured possession of the coast with an army of these dimensions, it would be impossible for the United States to dislodge the invaders. These disquieting reports are made use of by the Californian press to strongly demand the maintenance of an adequate American naval squa dron in the Pacific. It is rightly pointed out that the permanent fleet kept in those waters would be hopelessly out-classed by the naval forces of Japan. London, January 22. The Daily Telegraph reports from Tokio the speech delivered by the Japanese Premier, Marquis Katsura, at the opening of Parliament yesterday. The Mar quis said that while the friendly relations of Japan with other Powers showed a marked increase dur ing the past year, the Anglo-Japanese alliance had become even still closer and more firm. THE BRITISH PATENT LAW. PROTESTS|lN AMERICA. Washington, January 22. After a lively discussion, the Department of Com merce and Labor has appointed a special Committee to impress upon State Secretary Root the expediency of concluding a treaty with Great Britain for the protection of American patent rights. A deputa tion of the Department of Commerce and Labor called at the State Department yesterday to lodge a protest against the British Patent Law. GRAPHIC REPORTS FROM MESSINA. MORE SHOCKS IN SOUTHERN ITALY. (From our own correspondent.) _ London, January 21. Gne of the most lurid descriptions of the awful devastation at Messina is contained in a letter from a young British naval officer to his family here. e writes. Chaos absolute, blank, hopeless, ir retrievable chaos. That is all I can say. As fa,r as one can see, every second house collapsed, a great fire raging in the midst of Messina; cruisers and destroyers (Italian, English, Russian, French) hurrying about with medical comforts and stores invalids (barges full of them); and one knows that not half, not a quarter, of the suffering has been or can be alleviated by so much as a straw’s weight. A man came in to the captain today from a village some miles inland. He said that the village was wrecked. All the young men uninjured had fled, and the place was occupied by feeble old men and invalids. And then he had to be sent away without hope. There are hundreds of villages in just as bad a plight. The whole district is under martial law, and pillagers are shot at sight. We have heard plenty of significant shots out here. The English' share in the relief ought not to be forgotten for a long time. The “Sutlej” has taken three boats of injured to Syracuse. The “Minerva” arrived on Wednesday morning with stores. The “Exmouth” arrived the same evening with 30,000 blankets and medical stores; the “Philomel” on Thursday after noon with about a dozen doctors ; the “Duncan” on Friday morning, with stores, 60 R.A.M.C. men, and a full field hospital; and the “Euryalus” with stores, a few hours later. There are also two Rus sian cruisers, two French cruisers, one Italian crui ser, and two torpedo-boats. The King of Italy is here in person. When we shall get a mail nobody knows; and when you will get this nobody knows. I have been very busy today checking provisions, etc. We have landed a tremendous amount, and still have on board.—Biscuits, 10,3801b. ; flour, 19,6001b.; coffee, 4,9841b.; corned beef, 6,0481b. And it is but a drop in the ocean. An exploring party has just returned, telling the most gruesome stories.” In a letter, dated the following day, he says:— “I have been ashore with a stretcher party. I have seen enough misery today to last me for ever. We went about five miles inland, and from the time we left the shore to the time we arrived back I did not * see a single house that had not been destroyed. At some the roofs had fallen in, others a wall had fallen away; and of the majority there was just a heap, nothing more. One of the first things we came to was an old woman. Her shoulder had been put out, but bad as she was, she had to be left, temporarily. Then we came to a house in absolute ruins. Underneath were from seven to nine dead people—father, mother, and family. Of the uninjured natives, honestly, I do not believe one out of a hundred knew what he was doing. I know of two cases where people were buried under debris. Yet no effort was made to help them until we came and dug them out. There are at present many in the field hospital. If I were to tell you all the sights we saw in Villa San Guiseppe you would be horrified. Little babies, old men, women, are all the same. Some have broken legs, some arms, some injured chests; yet their relations do not want them t °^, t !l C€n to the h °apital. They try to hide them, and if they are discovered shriek until the injured are taken out of hearing. After we went on to another village called Rosalio. You see a mere pile of debris. There could not possibly be anything alive underneath. I am not a bit amazed now at the number of dead (which will probably reach two hundred thousand). The only thing that astonishes me is how the number is not greater. One thing I am sure of—the part played by the English. This will not be forgotten for many years to come. I (dare not tell you of some of the things we have seen. It is absolutely ghastly.” Naples, January 22. Dr. Gollins, the Bishop of Gibraltar, has arrived here from Malta.

The same papers favourably comment on the statements contained m a document published by the Army General Staff with regard to the construction of fortifications at San Pedro harbour, near Los An geles. According to this document, a “certain Orien tal Power” could land 100,000 men on the Pacific Coast within a month, and increase this army to 300,000 by the end of two months. It is further stated that, once the enemy secured possession of the coast with an army of these dimensions, it would be impossible for the United States to dislodge the invaders. These disquieting reports are made use of by the Californian press to strongly demand the maintenance of an adequate American naval squa dron in the Pacific. It is rightly pointed out that the permanent fleet kept in those waters would be hopelessly out-classed by the naval forces of Japan. London, January 22. The Daily Telegraph reports from Tokio the speech delivered by the Japanese Premier, Marquis Katsura, at the opening of Parliament yesterday. The Mar quis said that while the friendly relations of Japan with other Powers showed a marked increase dur ing the past year, the Anglo-Japanese alliance had become even still closer and more firm. THE BRITISH PATENT LAW. PROTESTS|lN AMERICA. Washington, January 22. After a lively discussion, the Department of Com merce and Labor has appointed a special Committee to impress upon State Secretary Root the expediency of concluding a treaty with Great Britain for the protection of American patent rights. A deputa tion of the Department of Commerce and Labor called at the State Department yesterday to lodge a protest against the British Patent Law. GRAPHIC REPORTS FROM MESSINA.

While the Tanin states positively that the. report published by the Agence Fournier of King Edward’s intention to visit Constantinople has not yet been confirmed, the Jeni Gazetta learns from an authen tic source that King EdWard will come here, and that his Majesty has expressed his wish that no reception may be offered him, as his visit w'ill be of a private character. The Jeni Gazetta lays stress on the importance of the visit, remarking: “The Ottomans will, of course, respect the King’s wish ; nevertheless, the simple reception will surpass all that the world has yet seen.” PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS. SPECIAL MESSAGE IGNORED. Washington, January 8. At today’s sitting of the House of Representatives a discussion took place on the allegation in Pre sident Roosevelt’s annual Message that Congress made reductions in the estimates for the secret police service because a number of the members feared that they would be brought under the observation of that secret service. The House had requested the President to justify his allegation and he had sent a special message in which he quoted the speeches of several members in justification of what he had written. The Committee to which the matter had been referred reported that the supposition of the President was unjustified and baseless, and that the House must decline to concern itself with a com munication which in the opinion of the Committee was derogatory to the respect due to the House. The special message was no answer to the request of the House and constituted an encroachment on its privileges, since it called in question the motives and the judgment of its members in the exercise of their constitutional functions. The House there fore declined to take into consideration that clause of the annual Message. DRESDEN CHINA ® ‘ Trade Mark.

The hall and tribunes were filled with deputies and their friends, and every Minister and prominent Parliamentarian was present. The Chamber Presi dent, Signor Mareora, prefaced his speech by thank ing the Deputies who had hastened to the Chamber to join with him in showing to the country that Parliament was united in a single feeling of affec tion and pity for the victims of the terrible ca tastrophe. Two important cities, Messina and Reg gio, the first of which had been a centre of ancient culture, and many other thriving districts had been razed to the ground. Thousands of their inhabitants lay dead beneath the ruins, while thousands more were injured. Words failed to express their an guish at such a disaster. The President, amid scenes of emotion in the Chamber, then eulogised the Deputies who had been killed. His speech was couched in most moving terms, and loud and pro longed applause greeted his declaration that Italy, the ancient mother of civilisation, took her place among the civilised nations in a fraternal bond of atiection and humanity. He was giving expression to the feelings of the entire country when he voiced his admiration of the King of Italy, who, by being one of the first to arrive at the scene of the ca tastrophe, has showed a high example of duty ful filled to the. world. The speaker also paid a tribute to the noble Queen Whose devotion and sympathy shown towards the sufferers had awakened the live liest feelings of gratitude, and their sincere and hearty wish was that the royal lady would be spared for many years of happy life. (Loud applause, and cries of God save the King and Queen!”) “Our thanks,” continued Signor Mareora, “also go out to the heroes of the foreign detachments who came and thereby placed us under a permanent obligation.” He hoped to witness the speedy re- building of the ruined cities, and to this end ex horted the Deputies to lay aside all party differences and join with the Government in an effort to remedv the misfortunes wjhich had befallen the country. A proposal of the President to publish all the sym pathetic addresses received from abroad, and the Italian answers thereto, in the official minutes of to day’s sitting was carried. Signor. Giolitti, the Premier, followed with a speech very much to the same effect. He was happy to see how the representatives of many nations had banded themselves together with the object of af fording speedy assistance to the earthquake victims. A sturdy people, he said, should not be stunned y the blows of Fate; they must restrain their emotion and concentrate their energies on repair ing the damage. Messina and Reggio must be re built.

TWO LADIES ACQUITTED. New York, January 8. Mrs. Erb and Mrs. Beisel, her sister, have been acquitted of the murder of Capt. J. Clayton Erb. The case was one of the most sensational trials ever heard in Delaware. Mrs. Beisel admitted shooting Capt. Erb, but said she acted in self-defence. It was stated that Capt. Erb was brutally ill-treating his wife when she summoned her sister to her as sistance. Mrs. Beisel said she was wresting a revolver from the Captain, who was about to shoot his wife, when she shot him. It was alleged that Mrs. Erb had tried to poison her husband several weeks pre viously. THE SEDITION IN INDIA. IMPROVED SITUATION. Calcutta, January 8.

The hall and tribunes were filled with deputies and their friends, and every Minister and prominent Parliamentarian was present. The Chamber Presi dent, Signor Mareora, prefaced his speech by thank ing the Deputies who had hastened to the Chamber to join with him in showing to the country that Parliament was united in a single feeling of affec tion and pity for the victims of the terrible ca tastrophe. Two important cities, Messina and Reg gio, the first of which had been a centre of ancient culture, and many other thriving districts had been razed to the ground.

The President, amid scenes of emotion in the Chamber, then eulogised the Deputies who had been killed.

Rome, January 8. A story related by survivors from Reggio shows that even an earthquake can produce its romance. A young student for the priesthood, aged 22, hav ing himself escaped, set to work to find his sister, who was beneath the ruins of a young ladies’ college. After three days, and quite by chance, he found her alive and well in a cellar full of dead and living people, but when they had embraced the girl told her brother that somewhere among the wreck age of the college lay her great friend, who she believed was still alive, and they determined to try to save her. To their great joy there came a voice which guided them to a fallen beam. Beneath it they found the girl for whom they were looking. She was not badly hurt, and when the weight was lifted off her the three made their way together to a safer part of the town. The young man, however, had fallen in love with the rescued girl, who was strikingly beautiful, and gratitude for her life had perhaps inspired similar sentiments in her. At any rate, they shortly afterwards met a priest, whom the student knew, and to whom he announced his renunciation of his career as a Seminarist, in order that he might marry her then and there.

No. 903. FRENCH NAVY SCANDALS. DEPRESSING OFFICIAL REPORT. Paris, January 27. The Paris Journal, taking as a basis the figures given by M. (Jhaurrtet, Reporter of the. Estimates for the French Navy in the Chamber, publishes the following estimate of the condition of the Navy:— Of 15 battleships 4 are in an indifferent or bad condition. Of the remaining 11, only 6 are good or very good. Of the 5 coast-defence vessels enumer ated in M. Chaumet’s report, 4 are absolutely worth less. Of 21 armoured cruisers, only 17 ought to be retained. Of 162 vessels comprising the tor pedo flotilla, the Paris Journal thinks that no more than 34 should be reckoned as lit for service. Of 68 submersibles and submarines 50 can be used. But the usefulness of these units is questionable, the submersibles and submarines which are at present in service are scarcely more, says the author of this computation, than more or less successful trial models, and will not become ^redoubtable engines of war until motor petrol has given more conclusive results. The same journal suggests the following distri bution of the 120 millions of francs required to make the facts correspond with the strength of the Navy on paper: For the most urgent repairs, 20 millions of francs; for supplies in magazines and arsenals, 80 millions of francs; for the supply of ammunition and powder, 20 millions of francs. These sums will have to be spent quite apart from what must be provided for the regular renewal of the material at the docks and of the stock of im plements. THE^EARTHQUAKE DISTRICTS. STRICT SANITARY PRECAUTIONS. Rome, January 27. A report published by the Director General of the Public Health department enumerates the sani tary measures that have been adopted in the earth quake region. These include disinfection, particu larly in connection with burials; the opening of dispensaries and hospitals; official analysis of drink ing water in places where the earthquake was se verely felt; supervision of the work of clearing away ruins; sanitary regulations for the building of 'huts, and general vaccination. Thanks to these preventive measures, the health of the survivors, the report states, is extremely good. Berlin, January 26. The total amount represented by the German re lief measures in South Italy is 4,500,000 lire; which does not include sums that are still coming in and not yet disposed of by the Relief Committee; nor the materials which will be despatched after today. Messina, January 27. A sharp shock of earthquake, lasting three se conds, occurred at 8 o’clock this morning, preceded and accompanied by subterranean rumblings. THE'LOSS OF THEREPUBLIC.” ANJAMAZINO PREMONITION. There is one extraordinary feature connected with the “Republic” disaster which comes within my own experience (says the Daily Telegraph correspondent in New York), and which appears worthy of in vestigation by experts in psychological research. Shortly after 5 p.m. on Friday, when the “Republic” had already put out to sea, a well-dressed man, apparently of good education, called at the Daily Telegraph office in New York and desired me to “cable to London about the shipwreck.” I asked, “What shipwreck ?” and he replied, “The White Star liner “Republic” will be run down before daybreak tomorrow.” I told my visitor that newspapers dealt chiefly in ascertained facts, and that prophecies were not worth much attention. “Why don’t you go to the New York offices of the American papers ?” I queried. “They are chiefly interested.” “That is the first place where I have been,” he said, “they won’t take any notice, and I want you to send a line to London.” I was about to dismiss my visitor as a crank, but I first asked him whether he knew anybody on the Republic. He replied that he had some dear friends aboard. His only reason for his gloomy prediction, he admitted, was a dream. I told him that a dream was often very unreliable, to which he answered, “Yes, I agree that one dream means nothing, but I dreamt this thing two nights in succession. The details were the same each time, and I awoke in a- fright on each occasion in the early, hours of the morning.” On my asking the man if he expected to be paid for his information, he replied, “No, I merely want to go on record. I don’t even want my name mentioned, and you won’t hear from me again.” My visitor then went away, and I dismissed the subject as trivial untjil the next day, when the afternoon papers were publishing reports of the collision, which actually occurred nearly twelve hours after my visitor had been explaining his amazing premonition.

NEW BOOKS RECEIVED.* Marcella, by Mrs. Humphry Ward, is too old a favourite to stand in need of further encomiums. This delightful tale had barely emerged from the press when it was caught up by the reading public as one of the novels that really count, find this verdict has been unanimously endorsed by critics of all shades. Its author is perhaps our greatest living lady novelist, and she has attained this proud position, not so much, perhaps, by the excessive scholarship of her language, but the distinctive na turalness of her stories and the comprehensive grasp of humanity’s little foibles. Her women are living and breathing specimens of their sex. Mrs. Ward has little sympathy with the blatant woman beloved by so many of her contemporaries; there is no tedi ous pamphleteering under the guise of dialogue; and female suffrage is left very much alone. De spite this, however, she invests her female charac ters with all the charm that is the natural heritage of Eve’s daughters when unspoiled by the insidious spread of miscalled “higher thought.” Mr. Frank Bullen is a sailor, and very much, so; in fact, you scent the refreshing deep sea breeze the instant you turn the first page of this collection of brief studies. When one considers the inexhaus tible fund of romance lurking in the depths of old ocean, and the countless marvels revealed to those who go about their lawful occasions on the high seas, it is remarkable that so few writers have stretched out their hands towards this tempting theme. We are not now speaking of the piany pseudo-sailors who compile amazing yarns of im possible occurrences on undiscovered oceans, and who have done so much to invest the seafaring life with a fog of misconception and garish sensationalism. Mr. Bullen has served before the mast, and there fore is well aware of the difference between the kelson and the cook’s galley, and the subtle shades of diversity between the main and mizzen masts. He is also blessed with the gift of observation, a gift for the exercise of which there is certainly no better field than the high seas. The book is a veritable vade mecum for the landlubber, while rea ders who have already come under the influence of the sea’s subtle fascination will revel in the honest briny atmosphere with which the pages are per meated. There is a tale of a greenhorn in \the litefary world, whose knowledge of reading was limited and peculiar. The waggish editor handed him a reprint of Vanity Fair to review as his first effort, and the greenhorn forthwith set to and slated “this ob viously inexperienced and manifestly presumptuous writer” with vigour worthy of a better cause. Bear ing this parable in mind we are averse to laying Great Expectations on the literary dissecting table, and will content ourselves with warmly praising the admirable form in which the publishers, Messrs. T. Nelson and Sons, are issuing their series of English classics at absurdly low prices. This characteristic specimen of Dickensonia will be welcomed by every body anxious to fill a modest bookshelf with the best among the best. The only fault we have to find with Mr. Vachell is his excessive tardiness in producing new work. He evidently works by a good rule—slow’s the word, but sure; and the result is that he is creating a distinct style of his own in this day of brazen plagiarism and hackneyed pot-boiling. The Waters of Jordan is essentially the story of a man and a maid, but of such a man and such a maid as we rarely have the good fortune to stumble across in the overgrown literary jungle. The dialogue is particularly excellent; of worldly wisdom there is much, but it amply justifies its presence; and the rich romance of the narrative is only exceeded by the masterly style which stamps each page. There is room for many more books from the same pen; but there is only one Vachell, and the demand must necessarily continue to exceed the supply. * Marcella, by Mrs. Humphry Ward. 1 Vol. Nelson’s Seven- penny Library.

THE DAILY RECORD, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1909. DRESDEN It has been found on examination that the high water and ice in the Elbe have caused considerable damage to the structure of the temporary bridge alongside the new Augustus bridge. This structure will therefore have to be renewed at many points and the whole greatly strengthened. Nevertheless, the temporary bridge withstood the battering it re ceived from the masses of ice and the strain of the current very well. The upper portions supporting the iron work sustained little damage, as they were partly protected by the new bridge and the founda tions of the old. The Neustadt end of the temporary structure suffered most severely, being entirely con structed of timber. Several of the supports have been rent in twain by the crash of the ice blocks. At one point where there were eight supports, only two dr three remain intact, and as a natural result the bridge has sagged slightly at that point. The damage can, however, be quickly repaired by the placing in position of new props. As soon as the water has quite subsided the entire structure will be subjected to severe tests; but it is anticipated that no traffic will be allowed upon it for a fortnight. With commendable foresight the engineers removed as much of the scaffolding as possible to allow free passage to the ice. Had this riot been done the conse quences might have been very serious; as it was, every piece of loose timber was torn away by the racing torrent. Before the bridge was closed the electric current was cut off, the car rails freed of their connecting plates, and the arc lamps removed, so that, in case part of the bridge collapsed, the amount of material swept away would be minimised. The water is now subsiding very rapidly, and will soon reach its accustomed level. The concert given at the Palmengarten on Mon day evening by Mr. Harry Field and M. Vernon d’Arnalle had a surprisingly cordial reception from the large audience of friends and others who had assembled to listen to them. I have seldom heard in the Palmengarten this winter such loud applause arid so many encores demanded, especially from the singer. That reception on the part of the public naturally had an inspiring effect on the artists, whose performances were correspondingly exalted. Mr. Field proved himself a sound and thorough musician. He evidently does not aspire to imbue his hearers with feelings and ecstasies such as the various com posers evoke in him, but successfully strives to pre sent to them a rhythmically wonderfully detailed and thoroughly correct rendering of his programme, thus enabling his audience to receive a direct jm pression from the composer himself without the intercession of his own feelings. Thlis calls for a great deal of self-command such as is but rarely met with in the concert-hall nowadays, and for which high praise is due to Mr. Field. Furthermore bis technique is clear and of no mean order, a fact to which he testified especially in the three IJ'szt pieces, which were best suited to his artistic style. Particularly in the Tarantella, from the “Itaiienische Reise,” he revealed a highly developed pianistiit power. Mr. Field deserved the laurel wreath which was handed to him at the end of the concert.— M. Vernon d’Arnalle began his programme with songs by Schubert. His fine voice is well trained in the middle register, while the hjiigh notes are without brilliancy. He characterises well; the vari ous ideas and meanings in the several songs were admirably represented; equal justice was done to the pathos of the “Gruppe aus dem Tartarus” and to the flow of melody in Schubert’s “Liebesbot- schaft.” But his rendering of Lowe’s ballad “Ed ward,” which he sang in the orginal Scotch dialect, was a Specially brilliant performance, worthy of the enthusiastic applause it called forth. He made this an affecting drama, and revealed astonishing power and fulness of voice, with high art in cha racterisation. In response to a storm of applause, he Sang songs by Brahms and Wolf, and some lighted French songs.—Herr Karl Pretzsch accom panied with his wonted reserve. 1 It will interest our readers to know what Wilden- bruch, the German play-writer who died quite re cently, said of Richard Wagner as a dramatist. Ten years ago Wildenbruch wrote a treatise on German drama, which was destined for America and included a chapter on “Richard Wagner as a dra matist” After a few critical remarks on the “young German” dramatists after Goethe, Wildenbruch goes on to notice the deplorable attempts to dramatise the Nibelung saga, aqd comments on them as fol lows: “Doubly significant is the manner in which the associated dramatists shrugged their shoulders as they passed by the man who was working and creating beside them, was seeking for inspiration and material from German saga lore, and who, while they belittled and ignored him, was the only one that recognised the grandeur of these subjects and could present them in drama form. “That man was the music-drama composer Richard Wagner, who not only towers above the “young Ger- nian” dramatists, but is the greatest genius among German dramatists from Schiller to the present day.

All those dramatists chose, for the dramatisation of the great subject, the Nibelungen Lied. Not to one of them did the thought occur that the Nibelungen Lied was itself a compilation, a re-arrangement of the origi nal saga. All their dramas, therefore, were re-ar rangements of a re-arrangement. The authors all failed to perceive, as the author of the Nibelungen Lied had failed to perceive, where the actual dra matic-tragic conflict in the story lay, namely in the relations between Siegfried and Brunnhilde. They all copied the author of the Nibelungen Lied, who had elected to make the fight between the Huns and Burgunders the central point of interest in the work, while hardly indicating what had passed be tween Siegfried and Briinnhilde, and so leaving the relation between the two entirely unintelligible. “The only one who had the insight to perceive where the dramatic-tragic root of the enormous sub ject lay, the only one whose hand was capable of arranging the materials round that root and so of constructing his drama, was the man at whose bold, sometimes singular, word-combinations the associated dramatists laughed scornfully, without feeling, with out even suspecting, what a mighty power of dra matic conception his work revealed. It was Richard Wagner who perceived that he was dealing with a saga, not with history, and that therefore the his torical garb in which the Nibelungen Died clothed the saga did not fit at all. With the decision of ,genius he grasped the Lied, tore away the material he wanted from where it did not belong, from the historic conflicts of men, put it ,iin jts proper place, in prehistoric ages, among gods and superhuman creatures, and, as he brought Siegfried and Brunn hilde into the centre of his work, made everything fit into and grow out of the relations between 'those two forms—created a drama, that today rules the world.” A lecture will be delivered next Tuesday, the 16th inst., in the Kiinstlerhaus, on the “Earthquake Cata strophe at Messina” by Dr. M. Wilhelm Meyer, a well-known writer, who was one of the first to visit Messina after the earthquake. The lecture will be illustrated by numerous photographic magic-lan- tern slides which were taken on the spot, and will be divided into two parts: the first one entitled— “New year’s day amongst the Ruins of Messina,” and the second—“The Earthquake of Messina arid the 'cause thereof.” Tickets may be obtained for 3, 2, and 1 marks at Tittmann’s bookstore, Prager Str. 19.

Marianne Goria as “Alice.” The fifth and last Philharmonic concert will take place at the Gewerbehaus on Tuesday evening, the 16th instant, with the assistance of the Berlin opera singer Margarete Ober. Signor Busoni has returned so exhausted from his trying English tour that he has been obliged to postpone a further tour which he had arranged to make through Italy. He fears that, in the present unfavourable weather, he will not to be able to leave Bordeaux in time to fulfil his engagement at this Philharmonic concert.

Reuter’s Berlin correspondent is authorised to state that, from the English point of view, the result of the political conversations between the English and German statesmen in Berlin is regarded as ex traordinarily satisfactory, and will apparently have an excellent effect on Anglo-German relations. The Imperial Chancellor was assured that the British Government has nothing but unqualified and hearty approval for the Franco-German Morocco accord, which is hailed as the foundation of a good under standing between France arid Germany and, there fore, as an influential factor in the betterment of relations between England and Germany. It is also declared that the aim of British foreign policy in the Near ""East is the maintenance of peace and the support of the status quo. The declaration made by Prince Biilow to Sir Charles Hardinge, to the effect that so far as support of the new order in Turkey is concerned, the British and German Go vernments are in complete agreement, is cordially welcomed in British official circles. The political discussions which took place during King Edward’s stay in Berlin were mainly most gratifying expla nations with regard to the policy of both countries. The Berlin correspondent of Reuter’s Agency is also empowered to announce that the King was most agreeably impressed by the warmth and cordiality of his reception by all classes of the Berlin public, and that the results of his visit are highly satisfac tory. OPINION IN ENGLAND. London, February 13. The leading articles in this morning’s papers all deal with the happy results anticipated from King Edward’s visit to Berlin, as follows:—Daily Chro nicle: “As a consequence of the King’s friendly utterances and of the good impression which his amiability and tact created, his visit will undoubtedly contribute to the elimination of the Anglo-German misunderstanding.” Daily Telegraph: “It is a simple and clear statement of fact when we say that the visit of the King and all the gratifying symptoms of courtesy and cordial feeling exhibited towards his Majesty from beginning to end, in the city streets, in the Palace, and in the Rathaus, have brought the two nations closer together, assuaged mutual acerbity, and diminished difficulties. The atmosphere through which we view things has become clarified in a truly remarkable manner.” Daily Graphic: “The King has given a powerful impulse to the movement in favour of Anglo-German friendship. We cannot doubt that the events of the past week have made an important alteration in the relations of the two Powers. The visit has loosed a stream of good will, whose flow will render diplomatic intercourse between both lands much less difficult. A new era in Anglo-German relations has now dawned; it only remains for both peoples and both Governments to use their best offices, and to persist along the path so skilfully indicated by their Sovereigns. If this is done all the sources of discord and mistrust will rapidly become dry.” GENERAL ELECTION FORESHADOWED. London, February 13. In the course of a speech delivered at Plymouth yesterday, Mr. J. A. Pease, M.P., a prominent sup porter of the present Government, announced that the Government would appeal to the country before many months had passed, as they had determined upon the abrogation of the right of veto by the House of Lords.

LINCOLN CELEBRATIONS IN AMERICA. New York, February 13. The entire country yesterday celebrated the cen tenary of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. The most important event of the day was a great meeting at Hodgenville, Kentucky, where President Roose velt laid the foundation stone of a memorial build ing to Lincoln, which is so arranged as to enclose and protect the log hut where the Great Emancipator was born. President JRoosevelt delivered an eloquent oration, in which he dwelt upon the significance and the statesmanlike career o'f Abraham Lincoln. THE NEAR EAST. Constantinople, February 12. A verbal Note addressed to the Porte by the Aus tro-Hungarian Embassy, calling attention to the in sults suffered by the Austrian Consular Agent at Alcxandretta, has been answered by the Porte with a denial of the allegation. The Embassy has now addressed a second verbal note to the Porte, de manding the punishment of the guilty persons. The report in the foreign press of an exchange of the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice, owing to the contemplated deposition of the Sultan, is unfounded. The report is believed to be the echo of an abortive conspiracy arranged by Interested parties. Many versions of the affair are circulating, and while nothing definite can be stated relative thereto, it is generally believed that the rumours are either exaggerated or completely false. The cere mony of Selamlik took place today without any di sturbance. Buda Pest, February 13. The local newspapers discuss Servia’s military preparations, remarking that the patience of the Dual Monarchy has come to an end* and as the situation becomes momentarily more irritating, the Government will finally be forced to take energetic measures. The Pesti Hirlay writes that Austria- Hungary will receive the support of the whole civilised world if she forces Servia, who is not only feverishly making war preparations but is also inciting her people to guerilla warfare, to feel the weight of the Dual Monarchy’s power.

The following notice has been issued by the Mi nistry of Marine:—Last month reports appeared in a Copenhagen newspaper and different provincial journals that German warships had illegally entered Danish territorial waters in the Little Belt and en gaged in manoeuvres which constituted a breach of international law and the rules of the sea. As these reports were of a nature calculated to arouse alarm and unrest among the populace, and as the suspicion that foreign warships had free access to Danish ter ritorial waters might detrimentally affect Denmark’s relations with her friendly neighbours, the Govern ment has inst.tuted a searching investigation into the matter. This investigation had proved that the state ments in question were quite devoid of foundation, and the rumours neither emanated from authoritative persons nor were accepted as true by people who possessed the qualifications to judge points of ma ritime law. The national defence proposals were introduced to the Storthing today in a lengthy speech by M. Neergaard, the Minister for Defence, in the course of which he declared Denmark’s intention of main taining her neutrality at all costs, and that the proposals provided for a well-ordered system of defence which would ensure this object and uphold the peace and neutrality of Denmark. The truth was that Europe was in a condition of tension and unrest, and had been in that condition for some time past. In the last generation the probability of Danish waters becoming the scene of a future war between the great European Powers had become sen sibly strengthened. After further remarks on the nature of the present proposals, the Minister said that although a large sum was called for, the great est possible economy had been exercised. It was an absolutely necessary condition for the national security that Denmark’s defences were formidable enough to secure her neutrality. This, he was con vinced, could only be the case if the landward de fences of Copenhagen were strengthened. The Go vernment made their retention of office a condition of the acceptance of these proposals, and would re sign were they to be rejected. SHIPPING DISASTERS; MANY LIVES LOST.

London, January IQ. Official arrangements respecting the visit of King Edward and Queen Alexandra to Berlin next month are now announced. According to these, their Ma jesties will leave London on February 8, arriving in Berlin the following day. The return journey will be commenced on Febriiary 12, so that the visit will not extend over three days. This arrange ment will permit of the King’s arrival in London in time for the opening of Parliament. Commenting in a leading article on the hopes expressed in the weekly political review of the Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung that the visit of the English sovereigns will result in a development of amicable relations between England and Germany, the Westminster Gazette remarks: “We heartily re ciprocate this friendly desire and can assure our German contemporary that the English people are as ready as their German neighbours to terminate the present condition of mutual suspicion. We have not the slightest wish to see Germany isolated, and it was without the least feeling of rancour that we witnessed the alliance between the German Em pire and Austria-Hungary which, conferring as it did benefits on both lands, thereby materially streng thened the prospects of European peace. That is a result plainly demonstrated by the recent Balkan crisis, and we hope that this bond will exert a lasting and tranquil Using effect on the affairs of Central Europe.” These amicable sentiments are echoed in many other influential journals; t in fact, no discordant note has yet made itself heard. In political circles there is a tendency to avoid undue expectations of any immediate or drastic change in Anglo-German relations as the result of the King’s visit, which, however, is confidently expected to prove the even tual basis of an new era. The conciliatory and sympathetic attitude of the German press is also greatly appreciated, and is here construed as an indication of the cordial welcome which King Edward will meet with upon his arrival in Berlin. The gracious courtesy of his Majesty which is a constant feature of his intercourse with foreign nations,and the indubitable peace-loving propensities of the German Emperor, supported by the efforts of the Anglo- German press, cannot fail to bring about marked improvement in the relations between the two do minant European powers. EXPENDITURE ONlARMAMENTS. MR. HALDANE’S VIEWS. London, January 19. Speaking at Halifax yesterday, the Secretary of State for War, Mr. Haldane, said that England had taken the lead in the endeavour to lessen the ex penditure on armaments; but, until the nations came to recognise that those enormous expenses could be reduced in the interests of peace and social re forms, it would be impossible to relax the pre parations for the defence of the country. CALIFORNIA AM THE JAPANESE. ARBITRARY MEASURE PASSED. Sacramento, January 19. The anti-Asiatic measure formulated by the Cali fornian State Senate and principally directed against the Japanese, was read for the third time * in the Senate here today. This measure, prohibiting as it does foreigners—everybody not a naturalised Ame rican subject—to own any sort of landed property in the State, is viewed with mixed feelings by those to whom California represents everything that stands for enterprise and progression. The measure which has now become law was recently described by Pre sident Roosevelt as “a piece of folly, bad faith, and iniquity.” Besides the property embargo, it empowers the various Californian communities to separate Ja panese residents from the white and confine them to certain localities, bars Japanese from piiblic schools, and puts various severe restrictions upon them in their conduct of business. FRANCE AND MOROCCO. GLOOMY SOCIALIST FORECAST. Paris, January 19. The debate on the interpellation on Moroccan af fairs was continued by M. Jaures, who expressed his fears that the conciliatory attitude and disinter estedness of France in Morocco, the object of which was to facilitate a rapprochement between Germany and France, were not agreeable to the hostile dip lomacy of leading circles in Germany; and that an Anglo-German conflict, which in certain quarters was described as unavoidable, would frustrate all hope of peace. M. Jaures then declared that the* settle ment of the ludicrous Casablanca incident had led to a triumph of the Arbitration Court, and that both countries had quite recently been working together for a peaceful decision of the Balkan question. M. Pichon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said he was entirely in favour of arbitration, thanks to which sound human understanding had lately tri umphed. France had put an end to anarchy in Mo rocco. The agreements with regard to the Algerian frontier were being carried out. Mulai Hafid had promised to safeguard international compacts. M. Regnault, the representative of France in Fez, would take no step that could violate the integrity of Mo rocco ; he would also come to an understanding with the Sultan as to the indemnity payable to France. VIOLENT ATTACK ON MR. ROOSEVELT. CONGRESSMAN SILENCED. Washington, January 18. In the house of Representatives today, one of the members, Mr. Willett, made use of such violent language against the President that a motion was made, and carried by 126 votes to 78, that Mr. Willett be no more heard. CHOLERA IN ST. PETERSBURG. St. Petersburg, January 19. There were sixty fresh cases of choleraic attacks in the capital on Sunday. THE FUTURE Of MESSINA. REBUILDING OR ABANDONMENT? EARTHQUAKE SHOCKS CONTINUE. Rome, January 19. In spite of the Government’s repeated declaration of its intention to completely rebuild the city of Messina, the vexed question is not regarded here as having been definitely settled. Opposition to the rebuilding scheme continues to grow in strength, and is supported by the statement given out by Professor Pater no, the eminent seismologist. “Mes sina no longer exists,” he said, “and can never again rise upon the same spot even if that should be desired. Messina will remain nothing but a vast cemetery.” This pessimistic point of view is borne out by all who have personally visited the scenes of devastation along the Straits. The history of Messina teems with instances of subterranean dis turbances more or less violent, and sound com mon sense must be irrevocably against hurling a chal lenge to Fate by reconstructing the desolated city. Indeed, every day brings reports of fresh shocks felt. Professor Paterno’s opinion merits careful at tention for many reasons, chief among which is the rumour, apparently founded on fact, that the Italian Government intends to devote a large portion of the immense sum donated from all quarters to the relief funds, to the rebuilding of Messina. The po pulace is described as depressed and hopeless under the long series of misfortunes which have overtaken them, and if the rebuilding scheme is eventually materialised, it is a moot point whether inhabitants will be found for the new buildings. Rome, January 19. The Osservatore Romano states that the amount of the contributions sent direct to the Pope for the benefit of sufferers by the earthquake catastrophe is 1,408,192 lire. Reggio neW Emilia, January 18. A sad fatality has occurred here. During a per formance at a cinematograph theatre for the benefit of the sufferers by the earthquake, there was an alarm of fire. A panic ensued, and in the crush at the exits two people were killed and several badly hurt. Rome, January 19.

THE DAILY RECORD, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1909. □I DRESDEN Prince Ernst of Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach died at noon yesterday in the sanatorium of Neuwittelsbach, near Munich. Many friends in Dresden will hear with regret of the death on Sunday last of the Rev. Professor D. W. Simon, who for some time past has been resident in this city. Dr. Simon held the rank of Emeritus Principal of the Yorkshire United Indepen dent College, Bradford, since his resignation of the active duties of Principal and Professor of Systematic Theology in 1907. In his work of Theological Lec turer, Dr. Simon was especially well fitted by his training first at the Lancashire Independent College, Manchester, and later at the University of Halle, where he gained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. In recognition of his eminent scholarship the Ho norary Degree of Doctor of Divinity was also con ferred upon him by the University of Edinburgh. He was a man of massive learning and was distin guished by his competence as a German scholar, a language which was to him interchangeable with his mother tongue. After his college career termi nated he spent some years in Berlin, where he acted as Director of the British and Foreign Bible Society and was associated with others in the founding of the cabmens’ mission, and in the establishment and extension of German Sunday schools. He was al lied with the Fatherland by marriage, his wife being a direct descendant of the old German family of Chemnitz, one of whom was the famous theologian Martin Chemnitz (died 1586), who was Superinten dent of the chief church in Braunschweig, where his memorial tablet bears the inscription “No Chemnitz, no Luther,” the significance of which is that without Martin Chemnitz the Reformation would have come to naught. With this adequate equipment Dr. Simon was called to be Professor and Principal at the Springhill Theological College, Birmingham. Previ ous to the removal of this foundation to Mansfield College, Oxford, he had undertaken the Principalship of the Edinburgh Theological Hall, from which po sition he became Principal of the Yorkshire United College. Dr. Simon’s knowledge of German literature, par ticularly in the realms of philosophy and theology, was unsurpassed by any British scholar, and no one was better equipped for the task, or more acute, in the prosecution of the duty, of investigating the extremer conclusions of German professors and writers. While himself fully abreast of modern re search and at all times ready to receive and to assi milate well-founded conclusions of theological science, he yet was able to do much to guide the thought of the time along safer and saner paths. As a writer he is well known, his principal works being: “The Redemption of Man,” “The Bible an outgrowth of . Theocratic Literature,” “Bible Problems,” and “Twice Born”—a volume of pulpit discourses. He was also in much demand as a translator of German theolo gians, among his wiork in this being: Stahlin’s cri tique of Kant, Lotze, and Ritschl, and the two vo lumes of Domer’s “Person of Christ,” one of which he translated and to both of which he contributed valuable critical notes. He wrote the article on Justi fication in Hasting’s Bible Dictionary and was a frequent contributor to English and American theolo gical journals. During his comparatively brief stay in Dresden he was a worshipper at the Scots Church, and ren dered invaluable service to the congregation by undertaking its pulpit duties for some months dur ing the recent interregnum. Jan Kubfelik appeared on Monday evening, after two years’ absence, to add fresh fuel to the fire of the re putation he'enjoys among his Dresden admirers. He has done so; his pale face surrounded by splendid black hair contributing, perhaps, no less to his success than his brilliant violin-playing. He is still what he was—the “wonder-man,” with the sweet tone and the even but by no means unique execution; the “Ratcatcher” who in fatuates female hearts by his sweet singing. Regarded from a musical point of view, he has not improved at all, has not become deeper. He plays—no matter what. It is always the charming tone and the smooth execution, always Herr Kubelik, that cajoles the public. He knows beforehand how to catch his audience. If one observes him closely, one knows his thoughts. His countenance betrays him: “Pay attention! now you will again be carried away.” And he is right in his reckoning; the audience is carried away, and applauds rapturously. Yes, it is a rare instance of success, and the riddle of his secrets Illustrated lectures on Art History; Study visits to the Art Galleries; For outlines and ""itineraries apply to Miss I. B.

Herr Kubelik played it as - he plays everything, with the sweet tone and the smooth execution,—played it as he played Lalo’s Spanish Rhapsody. It is indeed a matter of indifference what Herr Kubelik plays. His success is assured; the audience is jubilant. The longer Herr Kubelik played, the more the audience cheered on Monday; and when the Paganini Etudes and Hubay’s “Scene de la Czarda” had been heard, the applause became so frantic that the little pale Bohemian with the dark curly hair might have imagined himself in America, where skilful “reclame” can produce more enthusiasm than in prosaic Germany. It if. to be regretted that Herr Kubelik played without an orchestra, though with the clever pianoforte accompaniments of Herr Schwab. Thus the Concertos of Sinding and Lalo were heard in a mutilated form. But that is a matter of in difference. The chief thing remained: Herr Kubelik played. —One great merit the concert had; it made us acquainted with an unusually talented pianoforte-player, Herr Ludwig Raab, hitherto quite a stranger to Dresden. True, it was only frothy “must” that the young artist gave us; but it promised in course of time to become noble, golden wine, that will strengthen and elevate when once it is refined. The audience overwhelmed Herr Raab, too, with applause. 1 M. N. % The Leipzig police made a capture early yesterday morning under somewhat exciting circumstances. A workman named Heil, who was wanted on a charge of burglary, was traced to a house in the suburb of Kleinzschocher, in which neighbourhood he had been living by poaching. On seeing the police enter the house, Heil jumped out of a window, and attempted to escape, firing a revolver at the policeman nearest to him. He was about to fire again, when he fell, severely wounded by a shot from 1 a second policeman. He was secured and taken to hospital. -t— The guards in the city today are furnished by the 1st Grenadier regiment No. 100, whose band plays about 12.30 p.m. at the Schloss Platz.

Herr Bussel. PLOT. Don Gaston Viratos, a student, is discovered taking leave of his comrades. His money is rapidly vanishing while he is busily engaged in a flirtation with the daughter of his host, Inez, being assisted by his servant Ambrosio. Enters upon the scene Don Pinto de Fonseca, whose exceeding cor pulence arouses general amusement. He imparts to Gaston that he has come to marry a rich and noble lady, Donna Clarissa de Pacheco, whose hand has been promised him by the girl’s father out of gratitude for a service rendered by the suitor’s father. He is undecided how to proceed in the delicate matter of courtship, and Gaston thereupon offers to be his mentor. Subsequently they feast together, Don Pinto becoming the worse for wine. While his companion is lying in a stupor, Gaston steals his letter of recommendation to Donna Clarissa, and departs. The second act shows us the scene in Don Pantaleone’s ancestral hall, where he makes announcement of his daughter’s impending marriage. The lady, however, is enamoured of Don Gomez Freiros. a noble young knight, and is in despair at the prospect of a match with Pinto. Her maid Laura promises to discover a way out of the dilemma. In the third act the hail is decorated for the approaching nuptials. The servants all leave upon Don Pinto’s arrival being proclaimed, but Clarissa’s maid. Laura, hides. Gaston (the pretended suitor) now arrives and meets Don Gomez, who arouses the pretender’s sympathy by revealing his love for Clarissa. A plot is quickly arranged. Don Gomez assumes the role of Pinto, is furnished with the re commendatory letter, and introduced as the prospective bridegroom. The father is favourably impressed by his bearing, and gives consent to the union. All is thus going well when the unexpected arrival of the real Don Pinto complicates matters. His absurd antics arouse the belief that he is mad, but seeing Gaston among the guests he accuses him of treachery. The student threatens Pinto with a sword, whereupon the unhappy suitor, crying for mercy, is bundled out neck and crop. At this juncture Gaston reveals the plot. There is a general uproar; but Clarissa’s father is made to see the contrast between Pinto and Gomez, and finally, under the influence of his daughter’s pleadings, gives the couple his benediction. Gaston receives the grateful acknowledgements of Gomez for the part he has played in winning him a lovely bride. Composer: Carl Maria von Weber, born 1786, died 1826. Thursday night . . .

Reports from the storm centre in the Near East which have lately come to hand are distinctly of a more favourable tone. A week or so ago the situa tion bid fair to increase in tensity, and no small amount of bellicose talk was heard from both Vienna and Belgrade. Then came the speech of the Servian Premier, M. Milovanovitch, mistranslations of which duly reached the Ballplatz and were construed in to a definite menace against Austria. So deep an impression did this speech make, indeed, that M. Milovanovitch was quickly called to account. His sub sequent explanation appears to have been decidedly satisfactory to the Austrian Government, and it is now to be hoped that hotheads on both sides will endeavour to restrain their fiery utterances which add very greatly to the difficulties of amicably solv ing the tangled problem of ‘‘who's wfi'o” in the Balkans. It is all very well for Austrian politicians to lecture the Servian press on its agitative pro pensities. These gentlemen, however, would do well to set their own printing house in order if one of their journals, the Montags-Zeitung, may be con sidered representative. This organ, with unexampled bad taste, actually invited Italy to take notice of the fact that Austria had not profited by the disorder caused by the earthquake catastrophe to invade Italian territory. This ignoble attitude on the part of the Austrian press is not calculated to weld closer Aus trian and Italian sympathies. Turning towards Con stantinople, the outlook is very much brighter. The reopening of negotiations between Vienna and the Yildiz Kiosk, provided a conciliatory spirit s ex hibited by the parties concerned, should go far to wards assuaging the fears formerly entertained of an open rupture. Austria’s olfer to pay compensa tion for the Turkish State property iq the annexed provinces is an indisputable guarantee of her good faith. It is a pity that this proposition was not put forward long ago, in which case much needless alarm would have been spared. There is, of course, another side to the matter. It 4 is quite on the cards that the present dispute will be provisionally settled without further delay; that Turkey will consent to officially acknowledge the action of Austria-Hungary, and put on the best face she can; that the Slav States now so vociferously clamouring against the Habsburg policy will subside into silence.

THE SECRET SERVICE AFFAIR. Washington, January 10. President Roosevelt has published details of the investigation conducted by Post Office inspectors and Secret Service agents into Senator Tillman’s connection with an alleged “land grab” in Oregon, as embodied in the letter sent by the President to Senator Hale in obedience to the Senate’s re quest for information regarding the uses made of the Secret Service. The President undertakes to show that Mr. Tillman used his influence as a Senator in an effort to force the Government to compel the Railroad Corporation to relinquish its control of the land grants from .the United States in order that he, his family, and secretary might profit by the purchase of land, and .that the Senator used the granting privilege on nurperous occasions in the conduct of his private business. The Pre sident’s communication to Senator Hale extends to 3,000 words, and appended to it are copies of letters from Senator Tillman, in which he expresses a desire to secure several quarter-sections of Oregon land, and also reports by inspectors who investigated the affairs of the land company with which Senator Tillman was in communication. It appears that the investigation of the affairs of the land company which led to the discovery of Senator Tillman’s letters was made on Mr. Tillman’s own suggestion. Senator Tillman promises to reply to the President’s charges in the Senate on Monday. Washington, January 10. Senator Hale has called a sub-commission of the Senate, consisting of three members, in order to in vestigate the insinuations with regard to the relations between Representatives and the Secret Service con tained in Mr. Roosevelt’s Message to Congress. Washington, January 10. In consequence of the excitement produced by the remarks on the subject of the secret police service made by President Roosevelt in his message to Con gress, Senator Depew has given notice that Con gress will from this time forth enquire whether the persons nominated by the President for official posts are suitable. This course of action is regarded as an effective weapon against President Roosevelt. THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER. REMARKABLE RESCUE REPORTS. ALIVE AFTER FOURTEEN DAYS. Messina, January 10. About noon today the rescuers succeeded in ex tricating from the ruins a 43-year-old man, who had been pinned beneath the debris of his house for fourteen days. Under the circumstances, he was in remarkably good health. During his incarcera tion he had perforce to witness the slow death of his wife and four children. For the whole time he had of course been without provisions or water. Since yesterday inclement weather has prevailed here ; during the foregoing night a heavy storm broke! Several fresh shocks have also been experienced. Naples, January 10. I he American battleship “Connecticut” arrived here today. The battleships “Vermont,” “Kansas,” and “Minnesota” are expected shortly. Rome, January 10. General Mazza telegraphs from Messina to the Premier as follows: “On the 7th inst. six survivors were rescued from the ruins. Gold and notes to the amount of five million lire have been recovered and sent to Catania under military escort. Private persons have now received permission to save what they can of their household goods under the super vision of troops. In the town and vicinity order prevails, and only a few arrests have been made in consequence of looting. The rescue work con tinues without intermission. Every night patrols go round for the purpose of hearing cries for help which may proceed from under the ruins. The hygienic conditions are favourable. Fresh earthquake shocks caused a violent agitation of the sea today. Huge waves broke along the shore and swept away one of the wharves on which were piles of flour sacks, a wagon and horse, and three railway trucks loaded with provisions.” ^ . Bremen, January 10. Owing to reports received here by the North Ger man Lloyd Company from their officials, and from the maritime authorities at Naples, to the effect that no danger attends the passage of ships through the Straits of Messina by day, the Company has cancelled its orders issued directly after the earth quake, according to which the vessels of its Mediter ranean lines were to avoid the Straits and proceed along the west coast of Sicily. T , r ^ Rome, January 10. l he Chamber • of Deputies will not reassemble before February 16, instead of the date originally fixed, namely, February 3.

Reports from the storm centre in the Near East which have lately come to hand are distinctly of a more favourable tone. A week or so ago the situa tion bid fair to increase in tensity, and no small amount of bellicose talk was heard from both Vienna and Belgrade. Then came the speech of the Servian Premier, M. Milovanovitch, mistranslations of which duly reached the Ballplatz and were construed in to a definite menace against Austria. So deep an impression did this speech make, indeed, that M. Milovanovitch was quickly called to account. His sub sequent explanation appears to have been decidedly satisfactory to the Austrian Government, and it is now to be hoped that hotheads on both sides will endeavour to restrain their fiery utterances which add very greatly to the difficulties of amicably solv ing the tangled problem of ‘‘who's wfi'o” in the Balkans. It is all very well for Austrian politicians to lecture the Servian press on its agitative pro pensities. These gentlemen, however, would do well to set their own printing house in order if one of their journals, the Montags-Zeitung, may be con sidered representative. This organ, with unexampled bad taste, actually invited Italy to take notice of the fact that Austria had not profited by the disorder caused by the earthquake catastrophe to invade Italian territory. This ignoble attitude on the part of the Austrian press is not calculated to weld closer Aus trian and Italian sympathies. Turning towards Con stantinople, the outlook is very much brighter.

Austria’s olfer to pay compensa tion for the Turkish State property iq the annexed provinces is an indisputable guarantee of her good faith. It is a pity that this proposition was not put forward long ago, in which case much needless alarm would have been spared. There is, of course, another side to the matter. It 4 is quite on the cards that the present dispute will be provisionally settled without further delay; that Turkey will consent to officially acknowledge the action of Austria-Hungary, and put on the best face she can; that the Slav States now so vociferously clamouring against the Habsburg policy will subside into silence.

THE SECRET SERVICE AFFAIR. Washington, January 10. President Roosevelt has published details of the investigation conducted by Post Office inspectors and Secret Service agents into Senator Tillman’s connection with an alleged “land grab” in Oregon, as embodied in the letter sent by the President to Senator Hale in obedience to the Senate’s re quest for information regarding the uses made of the Secret Service. The President undertakes to show that Mr. Tillman used his influence as a Senator in an effort to force the Government to compel the Railroad Corporation to relinquish its control of the land grants from .the United States in order that he, his family, and secretary might profit by the purchase of land, and .that the Senator used the granting privilege on nurperous occasions in the conduct of his private business. The Pre sident’s communication to Senator Hale extends to 3,000 words, and appended to it are copies of letters from Senator Tillman, in which he expresses a desire to secure several quarter-sections of Oregon land, and also reports by inspectors who investigated the affairs of the land company with which Senator Tillman was in communication. It appears that the investigation of the affairs of the land company which led to the discovery of Senator Tillman’s letters was made on Mr. Tillman’s own suggestion. Senator Tillman promises to reply to the President’s charges in the Senate on Monday. Washington, January 10. Senator Hale has called a sub-commission of the Senate, consisting of three members, in order to in vestigate the insinuations with regard to the relations between Representatives and the Secret Service con tained in Mr. Roosevelt’s Message to Congress. Washington, January 10. In consequence of the excitement produced by the remarks on the subject of the secret police service made by President Roosevelt in his message to Con gress, Senator Depew has given notice that Con gress will from this time forth enquire whether the persons nominated by the President for official posts are suitable. This course of action is regarded as an effective weapon against President Roosevelt. THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER. REMARKABLE RESCUE REPORTS. ALIVE AFTER FOURTEEN DAYS. Messina, January 10. About noon today the rescuers succeeded in ex tricating from the ruins a 43-year-old man, who had been pinned beneath the debris of his house for fourteen days. Under the circumstances, he was in remarkably good health. During his incarcera tion he had perforce to witness the slow death of his wife and four children. For the whole time he had of course been without provisions or water. Since yesterday inclement weather has prevailed here ; during the foregoing night a heavy storm broke! Several fresh shocks have also been experienced. Naples, January 10. I he American battleship “Connecticut” arrived here today.

Gold and notes to the amount of five million lire have been recovered and sent to Catania under military escort. Private persons have now received permission to save what they can of their household goods under the super vision of troops.

The one bright tlture of the appalling catastrophe which has overtaken i?- fair regions bordering both sides of the Straits of Messina is the splendid res ponse made by the civilisd world to the agonised appeal for help which, has one up frdm the 1 stricken regions. It would be difuilt to name a country which has not despatched men or money to the afflicted districts, and in scie cases magnificent ri valry has been displayed n an endeavour to be first on the scene with assi/apce. Only a few hours had elapsed since the rece’t of the terrible news when British, Russian, Hrenc s and German .warships were speeding towards Me?na, there to land men and immediately begin the 'earl-breaking work of extricating dead and injured from the remains of what hnd been a flourishig city on the previous evening. l Washington no poner heard the dire news ’than it despatched a cablegram to Rear-Admiral Sperry, ordering him to detach several of his battle ships and send them post-haste to the Straits of Messina. The commander of the British Mediter ranean Squadron received similar instructions from London ; and the German Government lost no time in commissioning two cruisers on a like errand of mercy. Even little Greece sent warships, and as we write there are vessels from far Scandinavia steaming with all possible speed to join the inter national squadron whose flags are flying in the de vastated Straits. Generous subscriptions to the num berless relief funds which have sprung into being are reported from all quarters, and many of the foreign Governments have authorised large grants with the same object. It is impossible to read the harrowing accounts of the distress under which thou sands of survivors are suffering without expefieijj&ng a desire to alleviate it by every possible means. 1'he need of help today is equally as great, if not greater, than it was a week ago, for it follows tnat eacn f new, rescue entails increased demands on the piti- j fully inadequate resources which are available in ! the earthquake district. The starving must * be fed, \the naked clothed, and the injured tended: moreover, \jf a* horrible outbreak of epidemic disease is not tv. complete the work of annihilation, the latest Hy- gienuappliances and disinfecting material must be placed ax + he disposal of the physicians. All these necessaries cdSi Toney, and money is the crying need of the moment, t&x \ave already acknowledged the very generous support ""yven to the fund we ven tured to establish on oir own account, but the exigencies of the situation ae such as to warrant us in making a further appea. Every contribution, no matter how small, will be welcomed $nd duly acknowledged, and it may be as well to reiterate the fact that the money will Igo directly towards purchasing food, clothing, and rieans of shelter for the victims of the disaster, entrely irrespective of nationality or creed.

T- AMERICA AND GERMANY. A SENSATIONAL REPORT. ______ London, January *7. The Morning Post publishes a cablegram Trom its Washington correspondent to the following ef fect : “Germany is negotiating with the United States for a mutual agreement respecting patents. The United States have at present no law correspond ing to the law which prescibes the carrying out of patents by a German in Germany; but a Bill to supply that want has been laid before Congress. Germany has now offered not to bring her law into operation against the United States, provided that the United States, if a similar law should be there enacted, will refrain from putting it itn force against Germany.” The Morning Post is further informed that the German Ambassador has assured the State Depart ment that, if the above agreement is concluded, the German law will be applied with stringency against Great Britain; which would be equivalent to giving a preference to ‘the United States. (Wolff’s Telegraphic Bureau informs us that the German Ambassador in Washington has received no instructions to make such a statement to the United States Government. The last paragraph is charac terised as an invention.) SACRILEGIOUS BURGLARY. The Church at Baasen, in the Rhine Province, was broken into on Tuesday night by robbers, who carried off all the gold and siLver vessels and orna ments from the altar. The police have as yet no clue to the perpetrators. THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER. OUTBREAK OF SMALLPOX. HARROWING NARRATIVES. Rome, January 7. At Palmi, the greater part of which was des troyed by the earthquake, smallpox has broken out. The bacteriological institute of Milan has sent lymph enough for 25,000 inoculations to the phy sicians at Palmi. A meeting of survivors was held on the ruins of Messina yesterday, which was attended by a Senator and several Deputies. The meeting passed a re solution advocating the rebuilding of Messina as an historical and national work, and expressing the belief that Pdi liaineni, in accordance with, tne wishes of the entire nation, .would take measures to secure Messina against a repetition of the disaster and to give the city a new lease of life. In the course oi an interview with a press re presentative, Signor Orlando, Minister of Justice, declared that Messina would rise again from its shes. The town should be rebuilt by private in itiative, and the Government would probably lend the money on very favourable terms. The Minister paid a warm tribute to the unselfish conduct of the soldiers, who, after a long sea voyage, insisted on being allowed to join in the work of rescue at once. Fatigue was forgotten as long as there was a chance of saving anybody.

In the course oi an interview with a press re presentative, Signor Orlando, Minister of Justice, declared that Messina would rise again from its shes. The town should be rebuilt by private in itiative, and the Government would probably lend the money on very favourable terms. The Minister paid a warm tribute to the unselfish conduct of the soldiers, who, after a long sea voyage, insisted on being allowed to join in the work of rescue at once. Fatigue was forgotten as long as there was a chance of saving anybody. The King had given a splendid example of fearlessness and de votion, and continually passed under tottering walls, oblivious of the danger. The Queen had personally attended to the injured, and both she and the King assisted at operations. Signor Giolitti, the Premier, repeats that he will not have recourse to a loan to raise the funds necessary for the. organisation of relief works in Calabria and Sicily, arid will confine himself to setting aside a sum of 30,0,00,000 lire from the Budgetary surplus. This will be sufficient to meet the most pressing needs. The money that will afterwards be required will, according to the Corriere d’ltalia, be procured by means of an increase in the land and income taxes. Jt is expected that the requisite sum of 180,000,000 lire could be raised in two years in this way. ,The Corriere d’ltalia publishes a notice warn ing the public against individuals who are seeking to impose upon the charitably-disposed by cloth ing themselves in rags and representing themselves to be refugees from the earthquake region.

The one bright tlture of the appalling catastrophe which has overtaken i?- fair regions bordering both sides of the Straits of Messina is the splendid res ponse made by the civilisd world to the agonised appeal for help which, has one up frdm the 1 stricken regions. It would be difuilt to name a country which has not despatched men or money to the afflicted districts, and in scie cases magnificent ri valry has been displayed n an endeavour to be first on the scene with assi/apce. Only a few hours had elapsed since the rece’t of the terrible news when British, Russian, Hrenc s and German .warships were speeding towards Me?na, there to land men and immediately begin the 'earl-breaking work of extricating dead and injured from the remains of what hnd been a flourishig city on the previous evening. l Washington no poner heard the dire news ’than it despatched a cablegram to Rear-Admiral Sperry, ordering him to detach several of his battle ships and send them post-haste to the Straits of Messina. The commander of the British Mediter ranean Squadron received similar instructions from London ; and the German Government lost no time in commissioning two cruisers on a like errand of mercy. Even little Greece sent warships, and as we write there are vessels from far Scandinavia steaming with all possible speed to join the inter national squadron whose flags are flying in the de vastated Straits. Generous subscriptions to the num berless relief funds which have sprung into being are reported from all quarters, and many of the foreign Governments have authorised large grants with the same object. It is impossible to read the harrowing accounts of the distress under which thou sands of survivors are suffering without expefieijj&ng a desire to alleviate it by every possible means. 1'he need of help today is equally as great, if not greater, than it was a week ago, for it follows tnat eacn f new, rescue entails increased demands on the piti- j fully inadequate resources which are available in ! the earthquake district.

The Morning Post publishes a cablegram Trom its Washington correspondent to the following ef fect : “Germany is negotiating with the United States for a mutual agreement respecting patents. The United States have at present no law correspond ing to the law which prescibes the carrying out of patents by a German in Germany; but a Bill to supply that want has been laid before Congress. Germany has now offered not to bring her law into operation against the United States, provided that the United States, if a similar law should be there enacted, will refrain from putting it itn force against Germany.” The Morning Post is further informed that the German Ambassador has assured the State Depart ment that, if the above agreement is concluded, the German law will be applied with stringency against Great Britain; which would be equivalent to giving a preference to ‘the United States.

A magnificent laurel wreath bearing on heavy white satin the inscriptipn: “The American Asso ciation of Commerce and Trade in Berlin, To its Esteemed Director and Member, Herr Kommerzien- rat Ferdinand Hecht,” was to be seen in the rooms of the Association on Wednesday morning.

The difficulties encountered were so great that the brave sailors often despaired of being* able to rescue the sufferers in time. At 8.14 in the evening an other distinct shock of earthquake rendered the situation graver, and the work still more danger ous, for the tottering walls around threatened mo mentarily to collapse, burying together victims and rescuers. But not one of the sailors thought of abandoning the task.

The Bulletin of the American Association of Com merce and Trade in Berlin in its latest number agitates vigorously for a betterment of the postal steamer service between Germany and the United States, and pointedly calls attention to the short sighted policy evidenced in the new two-cent postal arrangement, whereby letters must be held back for the sailings of German steamships to be entitled to the new rate. The Bulletin says:—“For the past fortnight no express steamer has left a German port for New York, nor has the service from the United States to German ports been much better. The next Ger man Lloyd express vessel does not leave Bremen until January 19. This insufficient service is great ly embarrassing to business interests in both coun tries, and complaints are loud. Even if steamers do not get a full complement of passengers, ought German-American commercial interests to be so trammelled? With the advent today of cheap and direct mail transportation the situation will not be greatly improved, owing to the fact that much mail has to be carried on nine-day boats. Business re quires, at least, a weekly express service between German and American ports. It is to be hoped that the German lines will see the matter in this light.” , Professor William Morris Davis, the Harvard “Ex change*’ professor to Berlin will give address at A telegram from New York says that Professor Burgess, one of the “exchange professors,” in ad dressing the Germanistic Society, expressed his high appreciation of the German people, and asserted that no monarch has been so misjudged and mis understood as the Emperor Wilhelm II.

THE DAILY RECORD. SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1909. El We would again draw attention to the circum stance that the entire amount of the offertories col lected at the English Church of All Saints’ in Dres den tomorrow (Sunday) will be donated to the Lord Mayor’s (London) Fund in aid of sufferers from the terrible earthquake disaster in Sicily and Calabria. The twenty-fourth annual conference of the In corporated Society of Musicians was celebrated in London on Decembei 31 last by a grand orches tral concert in Queen’s Hall. One of the numbers on the programme is of particular interest to Dres den readers, having been written by a composer who is a well-known figure among the Anglo-Ame rican colony of this city. We refer to Mr. J. C. Ames, whose symphonic poem, “Sir Galahad,” was performed at the concert referred to above. Com menting upon this work, the London Standard writes: “From technical and constructive points of view ‘Sir Galahad’ was, perhaps, the most success ful work of the evening, the breadth and freedom of orchestration and the broad and melodious ‘Sir Galahad’ theme, which is finally worked up to a good climax, being most effective” Herr Alfred Sittard, the gifted Dresden organist, gave on Thursday evening, before a crowded au dience in the Kreuzkirche, the first of his organ recitals this year. His programme contained “Cho rale Preludes” only; the peculiar form in which German Protestant music has poured forth its poetry. The fact that Herr Sittard, in beginning with Bach and ending with Max Reger, gave a survey of the historical development of this form, lent special value and interest to the occasion. In Bach’s choral pre ludes, the poetical meaning of the text of the hymn is simply held amid the majestic splendour and mas sive grandeur of the musical structure. The melody of the Chorale is “sung” in one or other of the voice parts and treated contrapuntally, or it serves as the theme of a magnificent fugue. With Max Reger, whose famous arrangement of the Chorale “Wie schon leuchtet uns der Morgenstern” Herr Sittard played at the end of his programme, these choral preludes become organ symphonies, the different divisions of which draw their musical in spiration from the separate verses of the hymn-text. Between the Bach and Max Reger works Herr Sittard introduced the choral preludes of Brahms, op. 122, which only became known after the composer’s death; refined, fanciful compositions, full of tender melancholy and aptly bridging the gap between Bach and Reger. Herr Sittard overcame all technical dif ficulties, and they were sometimes very great, with easy grace. The absolute clearness of his phrasing and his admirable feeling for fine tone-blends were a constant source of enjoyment, and the unaffected simplicity of his style was throughout worthy of his great task. The performance was one that exalted the hearts of all who heard it; and it had the spe cial merit of being the best and quickest means of expanding and strengthening the understanding for organ works, which are far too little appre ciated. M. N. 1 Frau Meta Foerster-Bresson, the wife of the bass singer at the Royal opera, gave a concert at the Kiinstlerhaus on Thursday evening. Some years since, when this lady was studying the pianoforte under James Kwast at Frankfort on Main, she was con sidered to possess great talent which justified high hopes for her future success. Unquestionably, Frau Foerster does possess musical talent, but not pianis- tic talent. Her playing is too indistinct, inaccurate, and unequal. Her scales are quite uneven, her shakes confused, and her chords and octaves very uncer tain. All these defects Frau Foerster seeks to veil by abundant use of the pedal, and so makes her whole playing still more indistinct. That is a great pity, as she has good ideas of howi to study her composers and how to interpret them. That she showed with Brahms, whose B-minor Rhapsodie suited her particularly well. That the full effect of her intentions was not obtained, was due to in sufficient means. With Reger it was still worse. It is worthy of recognition that Frau Foerster placed the great Bach Variations with the pompous final Fugue on her programme, and that she played it with such sureness of memory. But this work requires different and grander treatment; not with the excess of motherly fervour that Frau Foerster felt for it. With Chopin she had better fortune; DRESDEN I Concert Agency H.

Wells made his first reputation as the author of brilliant scientific romances, after the man ner of Jules Verne. One early story, however, The Wheels of Chance, showed him as a subtle and sym pathetic student of the much-abused lower middle class. In Kipps he raises a member of this class to the level of the heroic. It is a story of a boy who becomes an assistant in a draper’s shop. The first part tells of his shop life, with all its dreari ness of outlook. Then by an extraordinary chance he falls heir to a fortune, and proceeds to train himself to be a member of the leisured class. How he loses his first fortune and finds a second, marries his first love and returns to the sober ideas of his youth, is all brilliantly and dramatically told in Mr. Wells’s story. It is a new type of art, for he uses none of the stage figures of ordinary fic tion. None the less it is pure romance, full of hu mour, pathos, and a wise philosophy. No more ori ginal and delightful book has been published in our time. No one who casually glances through the work of Lucas Malet will deny her more than ordinary literary merit' of the exotic type, coupled with a genius for originality which is sadly lacking now adays. This gifted authoress is well versed in the arts of her profession, in spite of the veiled super ficiality which characterises the narratives from her pen. Her studies of human nature are more dilettante than profound, and she is not free from a predilec tion for the suggestive. The Gate less Barrier, how ever, may be recommended as a distinctly clever and entertaining novel. As an exponent of modern English society Mr. E. F. Benson has made a brilliant name for him self. He is vigorous and yet discreet, just but sym pathetic, and he manfully resists the temptation to too closely create morbid “problems,” so frequently to be met with in latter-day fiction. The Climber is well up to the high standard which Mr. Benson has himself taught us to expect. It compares very favourably with earlier work from the same source. m * Kipps, by H. G. Wells.

No. 893.* RECOLLECTIONS OF SAXONY. By Lady Paget. IX, Before my lessons began 1 was sometimes taken to the great Easter fair at Leipzig. It lasted, I believe, three weeks, and was world famous; the great mart of exchange for all countries. We used to start in the dark, for it was a twenty-mile drive, and go for breakfast to my grandmother who had a house at Leipzig. The whole picturesque old town was tilled with booths, and the narrow thorough fares seethed with a motley crowd shimmering in every colour of the rainbow'. There were Russians and Poles with their furs, Turks with carpets, Ar menians, Chinese, Arabs, Japanese, Negroes, Italians, and Greeks, all in their national costumes. The booths were piled with foreign wares; panoramas, tight-rope dancers, merry-go-rounds, and musicians took up every other available space. There were circuses for the children in the daytime and theatres for the grown-up people at night, and celebrated actors and even stars like Rachel and Dejaset came from Paris. People flocked into town from country houses to hear them, for the generation of that day still had the French tradition. Christmas is, however, for every German child the pinnacle of the year. It is not only a time full of the intensest expectation and excitement, but it is very holy and mystical. The Christkindchen sheds its halo over every child. If on Christmas Eve you look through the curtainless window's of the poorest labourer’s cottage, you will see a little Christmas- tree lit up and adorned for the children. For weeks beforehand my mother, our governesses, and any lady guests there might be, were employed in mys terious work shut up in jealously closed rooms. We children passed the long winter evenings in gilding apples and nuts, and cutting out ornaments in many-tinted papers for the Christmas-tree. Every thing was made at home, and therefore more preci ous. My mother, who was the moving spirit in all these preparations, observed absolute silence ; but she went to town for two or three days and re turned with a carriage piled with parcels. It was, I believe, on one of these expeditions that the coach man, as it got dark, lost his way in the snow. My mother, perceiving a signpost at some little distance, sent the footman to read the directions. This man, very stalwart and rather illiterate, did not succeed in doing so, and uprooting the sign-post carried it to the carriage door for my mother to read. The village people and the servants had their trees be fore we had ours, and everybody received a pre sent adapted to their wants and their wishes; not the least of them w'as forgotten. The guests, too, had each a remembrance, pretty or pseful as the case might be. I remember one year when my mo ther’s ingenuity was particularly taxed to find the right things, as the Prussian army had been mobi lised, and we, being at one of my father’s Prus sian places, had for five or six weeks over thirty officers quartered in the house. The great ball-room was made into a wood of fir-trees with one very large one in the middle. They were all covered with glittering fruit and coloured devices, and lit with hundreds of wax tapers. This was the last Christ mas in one of our beloved homes, so soon and so sadly to be broken up. As I look back it seems to me that life in those days was so simple, so ample, so dignified. There was breathing time and space, and people grasped events; whilst now they seem to slip through their fingers and their thoughts. There were no tele grams, no telephones, no electricity, no bicycles or motors—such things had never been thought of; and when an old woman in the village prophesied just before her death that carriages would run on the roads without horses, and people fly along on a wheel as fast as trains went (in those days), every body said she was mad. I hear people now talk ing of communicating with Mars. Are they so very mad as we think? My only excuse for recalling these childish, and I fear too personal, memories is that they refer to a time already so far distant that very few remember it, and a younger genera tion may be amused and astonished that once there were those who lived with so little excitement and yet were quite happy and contented.

No. 893. □ BERLIN Up to going to press our usual Berlin letter had not arrived, presumably owing to a delay in the post, and we therefore regret the dearth of Berlin social news in this issue. 1 According to latest reports, the King and Queen of England are expected to arrive in Berlin on Fe bruary 8th, and will make a five days’ stay at the Imperial Court. Their Majesties’ suite will include: Lord Althorpe, the Lord Chamberlain; Lord Howe, Lord Granville, Major Ponsonby, Lady Antrim, and Miss Knollys, sister of the King’s private secre tary. Sir Charles Hardinge will also accompany his Majesty as representative of the British Foreign Office. The German Ambassador in London, Count Wolff- Metternich, last Wednesday delivered to the Vice- Chancellor of Oxford University the portrait of Em peror William painted by Professor Schwarz. The portrait shows the Emperor in the robes of a Doc tor of Law, which honorary degree was conferred on his Majesty by Oxford University during the Imperial visit to England in the close of 1907. The portrait was some time ago on exhibition in Berlin at Schulte’s gallery. It will be hung in the Com memoration Hall of the University. Princess Anna zu Schaumburg-Lippe (nee Princess of Sachsen-Altenburg) has arrived in Berlin and taken up her residence at the Hotel Continental. On Tuesday next, January 19, at 7.30 p.m. a concert will be given in the Philharmonie for the benefit of the earthquake sufferers in Sicily and Calabria. This concert, which is under the patronage of the Crown Prince, was arranged by Colonel Chelius, and an honorary committee, including Coun tess Harrach, has been formed. Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress have consented to attend the concert, which is expected to prove highly success ful. Tickets are obtainable at Bote and Bock’s and Wertheim’s music stores. A particularly interesting and unique dog show is to be held in the exhibition hall of the Berlin Zoological Garden from February 20th to 23rd, in clusive. Two of the four days will be devoted to viewing and judging dogs not employed for sport ing purposes,—viz. lap-dogs, dwarf dogs, dogs trained for ambulance, war, police, and sheep duties; while the other days will be set apart for judging sport ing dogs. This arrangement is expected to be cor dially welcomed by exhibitors and spectators, as it will avoid all confusion and greatly facilitate the careful judging of the respective animals. Prospec tive exhibitors and others desirous of obtaining in formation about the exhibition should write to the office of the “Hektor-Ausstellung,” Potsdamer Strasse 125, Berlin, W. Another student of the Institut Tilly, Berlin-Gross- Lichterfelde, this time a lady, Miss Pearl Hart (A.B. of Grinnell- College) from Centreville, Iowa, passed on Friday a very successful examination for the German Diploma of the Association Phonetique Inter nationale. Prof. Vietor, of Marburg University, gave her the mark “gut bis sehr gut.” Beautlfiilfy furnished flat, 8 rooms, bath-room, kitchen, to rent for one or two years. Frau Molis, BERLIN, Karlsruher Str.29. Sir Thomas Barclay writes to Wolff’s Telegraphic Agency to say that the reports published in several German newspapers of an interview which he had with a representative of the Neue Freie Presse are quite inc'orrect, and that he desires to state positively that he disclaims all responsibility for the purport of the interview as published. For the first eleven months of last year the vo lume of emigration from the ports of Hamburg and Bremen, we read, showed a marvellous de crease as compared with the figures for the corres ponding months of 1907. Strange to say, the re turns for December show that 7,248 emigrants sail ed from Hamburg as compared with 6,494 persons in 1907, while the emigrants through Bremen were 11,968, as against 6,186 emigrants in December, 1907. But it must be remembered that almost the whole of the emigrants from the port of Bremen were Russian Jews or Polish Jews, and the great in crease for the month referred to must not be taken as representing really the tide of emigration of Ger man workers seeking new homes and work across the seas. During 1907 the emigrants from Hamburg num bered 189,810; last year they numbered only 78,878 souls, a decrease of 110,832 persons, while from Bremen there sailed in 1908 only 74,626 persons, as compared with 231,011 in 1907, or a decrease of 156,395 souls. One of the strangest marriages on record has just taken place at Boston, Mass., Capt. Conasi, of the Italian Navy, marrying Miss Jane Leland, an American heiress. The captain was in attend ance on the Duke of the Abruzzi during his me morable visit to the United States. He was intro duced to the lady at a reception. He knew no English, and she was ignorant of Italian. By chance he made a remark in Japanese. , To his astonishment the lady replied in the same lan guage. Explanations followed. He had been sta tioned at Japan. She had lived there with her fa ther for some three years. Each for love-making abandoned the natural tongue, and Japanese took the place of Esperanto, at least so says a Paris contemporary. BRITISH AND AMERICAN REPRESENTATIVES.

MOST COMPLETE COMMERCIAL READING ROOM in Germany Americans welcome. Geo. S. Atwood, Secretary. Messina, January 14. It has been raining heavily here since Tuesday evening. Another shock of earthquake was felt yes terday, but the night passed quietly. The census of the survivors in Messina is now nearly completed. Rome, January 15. The Emperor William has conferred the Order of Louisa on the Queen of Italy. The Popolo Ro mano remarks: “This amicable and spontaneous de cision of the friendly and allied ruler will be re ceived by all Italians without exceptions with sin cere pleasure.” MALICIOUS RUMOUR CONTRADICTED. Copenhagen, January 15. During the Parliamentary debate on the second reading of the budget of the Ministry of War, the Minister for Defence expressed the regret with which he had seen reports of the presence of foreign war ships in Danish waters for purposes of exercise. Such reports, said the Minister, only did harm ; the enquiries which had been held had proved their utter baselessness. DEATH OF ADMIRAL ROJE8TVEN8KY. St. Petersburg, January 14. Vice-Admiral Rojestvensky died early this morning. (It will be remembered that a report of this of ficer’s death was published in the press some months ago, to be followed by a denial from the Admiral himself.) PIT DISASTER IN HUNGARY. HEAVY LOSS OF LIFE. Veszprim, January 14. An explosion of firedamp occurred yesterday in the coal-mine here in consequence of a short cir cuit. Six dead bodies have so far been found, but it is feared that there were many more miners at work in the mine at the time of the explosion. Later. During last night the fire caused by the explo sion was localised and all the exits were cleared. Out of 240 men who are now known to have entered the mine, 14 have been got out alive, and 46 dead bodies have been recovered. There are hopes of saving the rest. THE TROUBLE IN THE BALKANS. ENGLISH POLITICAL OPINION. London, January 15. Speaking on Thursday at Leicester on the Balkans question, Mr. Churchill, the President of the Board of Trade, remarked that the situation in Europe had undergone a marked improvement in the last few days, but that it was not entirely free from anxiety. The alteration of the status quo in the East had not been a sufficient cause of war. If no uncontrollable incident occurred, a peaceable solution was assured. DEATH OF A WELL KNOWN AUTHORESS. The Press Association says:—The death is an nounced, in tragic circumstances, of Mrs. Evelyn Greenleaf Sutherland, of Boston, U.S.A., who was well known in theatrical circles under the nom-de- plume of “John Rutherford” as the authoress of The Breed of the T re shams and Monsieur Beaucaire. Mrs. Sutherland had the misfortune to accidentally set fire to her clothing at an open gas stove, and although her injuries might not necessarily have proved fatal, the shock was too great for a weaken ed heart. In addition to the two plays before men tioned, Mrs. Sutherland also wrote “The Road to Yesterday,” another successful play. THE FRENCH PRESS AND ALSACE> LORRAINE. Strasburg, January 15.

No. 893. □ BERLIN Up to going to press our usual Berlin letter had not arrived, presumably owing to a delay in the post, and we therefore regret the dearth of Berlin social news in this issue. 1 According to latest reports, the King and Queen of England are expected to arrive in Berlin on Fe bruary 8th, and will make a five days’ stay at the Imperial Court. Their Majesties’ suite will include: Lord Althorpe, the Lord Chamberlain; Lord Howe, Lord Granville, Major Ponsonby, Lady Antrim, and Miss Knollys, sister of the King’s private secre tary. Sir Charles Hardinge will also accompany his Majesty as representative of the British Foreign Office. The German Ambassador in London, Count Wolff- Metternich, last Wednesday delivered to the Vice- Chancellor of Oxford University the portrait of Em peror William painted by Professor Schwarz. The portrait shows the Emperor in the robes of a Doc tor of Law, which honorary degree was conferred on his Majesty by Oxford University during the Imperial visit to England in the close of 1907. The portrait was some time ago on exhibition in Berlin at Schulte’s gallery. It will be hung in the Com memoration Hall of the University. Princess Anna zu Schaumburg-Lippe (nee Princess of Sachsen-Altenburg) has arrived in Berlin and taken up her residence at the Hotel Continental. On Tuesday next, January 19, at 7.30 p.m. a concert will be given in the Philharmonie for the benefit of the earthquake sufferers in Sicily and Calabria.

The alteration of the status quo in the East had not been a sufficient cause of war. If no uncontrollable incident occurred, a peaceable solution was assured. DEATH OF A WELL KNOWN AUTHORESS. The Press Association says:—The death is an nounced, in tragic circumstances, of Mrs. Evelyn Greenleaf Sutherland, of Boston, U.S.A., who was well known in theatrical circles under the nom-de- plume of “John Rutherford” as the authoress of The Breed of the T re shams and Monsieur Beaucaire. Mrs. Sutherland had the misfortune to accidentally set fire to her clothing at an open gas stove, and although her injuries might not necessarily have proved fatal, the shock was too great for a weaken ed heart. In addition to the two plays before men tioned, Mrs. Sutherland also wrote “The Road to Yesterday,” another successful play. THE FRENCH PRESS AND ALSACE> LORRAINE. Strasburg, January 15.

The Popolo Ro mano remarks: “This amicable and spontaneous de cision of the friendly and allied ruler will be re ceived by all Italians without exceptions with sin cere pleasure.” MALICIOUS RUMOUR CONTRADICTED. Copenhagen, January 15. During the Parliamentary debate on the second reading of the budget of the Ministry of War, the Minister for Defence expressed the regret with which he had seen reports of the presence of foreign war ships in Danish waters for purposes of exercise. Such reports, said the Minister, only did harm ; the enquiries which had been held had proved their utter baselessness. DEATH OF ADMIRAL ROJE8TVEN8KY. St. Petersburg, January 14. Vice-Admiral Rojestvensky died early this morning. (It will be remembered that a report of this of ficer’s death was published in the press some months ago, to be followed by a denial from the Admiral himself.) PIT DISASTER IN HUNGARY. HEAVY LOSS OF LIFE. Veszprim, January 14. An explosion of firedamp occurred yesterday in the coal-mine here in consequence of a short cir cuit. Six dead bodies have so far been found, but it is feared that there were many more miners at work in the mine at the time of the explosion. Later. During last night the fire caused by the explo sion was localised and all the exits were cleared. Out of 240 men who are now known to have entered the mine, 14 have been got out alive, and 46 dead bodies have been recovered. There are hopes of saving the rest. THE TROUBLE IN THE BALKANS. ENGLISH POLITICAL OPINION. London, January 15. Speaking on Thursday at Leicester on the Balkans question, Mr. Churchill, the President of the Board of Trade, remarked that the situation in Europe had undergone a marked improvement in the last few days, but that it was not entirely free from anxiety. The alteration of the status quo in the East had not been a sufficient cause of war. If no u","Concert for Earthquake Sufferers in Sicily and Calabria.On Tuesday next, January 19, at 7.30 p.m. a concert will be given in the Philharmonie for the benefit of the earthquake sufferers in Sicily and Calabria. This concert, which is under the patronage of the Crown Prince, was arranged by Colonel Chelius, and an honorary committee, including Countess Harrach, has been formed. Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress have consented to attend the concert, which is expected to prove highly successful. Tickets are obtainable at Bote and Bock’s and Wertheim’s music stores."

AMERICA AM HER NEIGHBOURS. Some days ago, as our readers may recollect, we published a short article on the “American po licy"" of this paper, based on a communication re ceived from one of our readers, resident in Paris. This gentleman now writes us again, to the follow ing effect:— Your very kind iway of inserting my last note to you in the Daily Record is fully appreciated, and I am sorry to have misjudged in any way the policy of your paper. It lies on my mind con stantly to work for the improvement of the re lations between other countries and my own, and I wish I had the wit to accomplish something in that direction. What a vast improvement there would be in this old world of ours if those who mould public opinion, especially editors, would unite to promote good will among the nations! “Sometime, as you* find opportunity, write up America's good faith towards Cuba; or about the remission of 18 million dollars of the Boxer in demnity fund to China; or the progress of educa tion in the Philippines; or the great temperance re form movement that lately swept over the United States; or of that wonderful moral victory ob tained over the gambling interests in New York State; or on the value of agitation as a means of bringing about national reforms."" THE UNITED STATES AMD TURKEY. NAVAL TRAINING FOR TURKISH CADETS. London, January 15. The Daily Chronicle publishes a report from Washington that the United States Navy Depart ment, acceding to the request of the Turkish Go vernment, has given instructions that ten Turkish naval officers, among whom is a son of the Sultan, are to be allowed to join Admiral Sperry’s battle ship fleet in the Mediterranean for the voyage to America, in order that they may study the service routine on board American warships. INTERNATIONAL SHIPBUILDING. HUGE COMBINE PROPOSED. Newcastle, January 15. A meeting of shipowners took place here yester day. The state of maritime trade was discussed, and a resolution adopted affirming the need of form ing an international Union for mutual support. A committee was appointed, which will begin by plac ing itself in communication wjith the shipowners of the United Kingdom. THE BRITISH ARMY'IN WARTIME. DEARTH OF OFFICERS. Belfast, January 15. Mr. Lucas, the Under Secretary of the War Of fice, said in a speech delivered yesterday to a number of officers that, as a consequence of the late reorganisation of the army, 165,000 men could now be sent abroad at one time. The problem, however, was, how that army was to be kept up to its strength during a long campaign. In a great war with a civilised Power it was possible that 100,000 men and 5,000 officers would be required to maintain the regular army during the first six months. The required number of men would hap pily be available from the special reserve, but not the officers, who were even more important. PRINCE ADALBERT IN A GALE. Kiel, January 15. Prince Adalbert of Prussia, who in the early days of.this month made his first cruise in his new po sition as Commander pi a torpedo-boat destroyer, had to contend with very heavy weather in the Bal tic. Some of the vessels of the torpedo-boat squa- lron sustained damages. H. G. B. Peters Established 1885.

UNPARALLELED ACTIVITY. (Special to the Daily Record.) It is a striking commentary on the well meant efforts of passivists the world over that international competition in naval armaments becomes more strenu ous with every passing year. A glance at the amount of fighting material launched during 1908 testifies to the truth of this assertion. No fewer than 255,750 tons of warships were launched by the great naval Powers during the past year, the respective figures being as follows: Germany (4 battleships, 1 armoured cruiser, 2 small cruisers), ‘ total 94,900 tons; Great Britain (2 battleships, one cruiser), total 45,400 tons; United States (2 battleships), total 35,800 tons; Italy (3 armoured cruisers), total 29,700; Brazil (1 battleship), 20,000 tons; Austria- Hungary (1 armoured cruiser), 14,600 tons; France (1 armoured cruiser), 14,000 tons; and Japan (1 cruiser), 1,350 tons. From these figures it will be observed that Germany launched more than double the number of ships than England in the same period, this fact being attributable to the delays experienced in connection with the German pro gramme of the preceding year, so that the sum total of warships launched by Germany in 1908 actually includes those which, under ordinary cir cumstances, should have taken the water in 1907. It should, moreover, be remembered that Germany launched no large war vessel during 1907. The above figures by no means represent the high-water mark of international naval competition. Reports from Washington announce that the Secre tary for the Navy advocates the building of four American battleships each with a displacement of 25,000 tons. These may be reduced to two, each costing over $12,500,000 (£2,500,000), but the ex ample thus set by the United States in raising the tonnage of battleships to this huge figure will as suredly be followed by other maritime Powers. The “burden of armaments"" becomes a pregnant )hrase indeed when it is seen that a squadron of four modern battleships represents a sum of fifty million dollars. And the plain truth is that an international agreement to limit the dimensions of naval armaments was never less a possibility than it is today. BR1T1SH'HQRSES~F0R AUSTR1AN*ARMY. The Vienna journal Die Zeit states that General Baczak, Inspector of Remounts, is proceeding to England to buy 50 horses for stud purposes. THE NEAR EAST. SEHSATIOHAL STORIES FROM SERVIA. RUSSIA AND THE BOYCOTT MOVEMENT. Vienna, January 15. The Neue Freie Presse publishes a telegram from Semlin that there is no foundation for the rumour that King Peter of Servia would announce his ab dication at a meeting of his Ministers this after noon. Yesterday evening a Court ball was given at Belgrade; today the usual New Year’s Day ceremonies took place at the palace. Both those festive occasions passed off in the usual manner. Belgrade, January 15. There has long been great tension between the Crown Prince of Servia and the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, Count Forgach, and it was feared that a violent scene might occur at the Court ball. Ow ing to the interference of the King and the Govern ment, the result was attained that the Crown Prince confined himself to ignoring Count Forgach, who was present with the Countess. Constantinople, January 14. The arrest of persons charged with complicity in the Fedokiaran plot continue. It is reported that the assistant of the Mutessarif of Pera has been arrested. The .newspapers state that the full details of the plot are not yet known. It appears that the Committee intended to create disturbances and to threaten the Ambassadors. One account says that the members of the Committee intended to make a demonstration during the reading of the Grand Vizier’s speech; another that they had de termined to get up an agitation on the question of the succession to the Throne. The manufacturers of St. Petersburg, Moscow, Po land, and the northern regibn of European Russia have, says a St. Petersburg report, combined and drawn up regulations, which the Russian Govern ment has just approved, with a view to taking ad vantage of the boycott of Austrian goods now being carried out so successfully in the Balkans. This union of Russian manufacturers has already orga nised in Constantinople an exhibition of patterns and samples of Russian goods; this exhibition has at tracted a great deal of attention, and the results have been very gratifying so far. It remains to be seen whether the Russian firms can follow up the success that they may now gain in the markets of the Near East. Another Russian bank is to open a branch in Constantinople; this is the Azov and Don Bank. THE SICILIAN CATASTROPHE. GERMAN HONOUR FOR ITALIAN QUEEN. Messina, January 14. Signor Casano, the Minister of War, arrived here today. He visited many of the sanitary stations and barrack huts. The wiork of erecting a provisional hospital has been commenced.

All business communications, relating to advertisements, etc., should be sent direct to the Dresden office:—Struve Sir. 5. ■OP” Copies of The Daily Record may be obtained at Sclmar Hahne’s bookstore, Charlottcnburg, Joachimstiialer Strasse 44, opposite the Zoological Garden station. English residents of Berlin will be thoroughly well repaid by a visit to the small exhibition of paintings now on view in the studio (at Hardenberg Str. 12) of M. de Swertschkoff, latterly of London, and one of Russia’s best-known animal-painters. The King of England, as lately stated in the Record, is M. de Swertschkoff’s most distinguished patron, and the choice little exhibition in the Hardenberg Strasse holds personal interest for English people in asmuch as it contains portraits of two of the King’s favourite horses, “Persimmon’’ and “Florizelli.” King Edward declared that these pictures, both of them painted at Sandringham, were the two best portraits of horses he had ever seen. So pleased was his Majesty with the artist’s work that he last year sent the one of “Persimmon” to the Royal Academy. To the lover of art for art’s sake, the chief charm of this selection of works lies, perhaps, in the fine portraits of lions, done in water-colours. Some of the smaller pictures are splendid representations of . Russian Borsoy hounds, and there is an especially good portrait of “Beetle,” a small Yorkshire terrier belonging to a lady in Berlin. A “Deutsche Dogge,” done with startling likeness to life, is also among the collection. , . The following extract from a letter written from Buckingham Palace to M. de Swertschkoff in 1908, gives some idea of the high esteem in which King Edward held the Russian painter. ...Your letter of today’s date (writes Sir Dighton Probyn) I have submitted to the King, arid 1 write now by His Majesty’s command to inform you that your excellent little picture of the great horse “Per simmon,” now, alas, dead, may most certainly be exhibited at the Academy this year. What His Majesty proposes is, to send the pic ture in his Majesty’s own name to the Royal Aca demy, later in the month, explaining that it was painted by you last summer, and that His Majesty wishes it to be exhibited at the exhibition this year. In fact His Majesty has commanded me to ar range this with Mr. Eaton at once... M. de Swertschkoff, who is as modest and retiring as he is gifted, was educated in his father’s studio. Swertschkoff Senior was the best known animal and battle painter of his time in Russia—a friend of Em peror Nicholas I. and of the present Tsar. His son, the present exhibitor, has received three times at the hand of the present Tsarina the Emperor’s prize for amateur racing {Herrenreiten) t and was for twelve years the only gentleman jockey in Russia. Mrs. Lemuel H. Murlin, the wife of the Acting- Pastor of the American Church, will be at home on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month from 5 to 7 p.m. at Bayreuther Strasse 39. The Lyceum Club was very full on Monday evening last, when a charming “Weihnachtsfeier'' was held. Some old German Christmas music (vocal duets) open ed the evening, both soprano and alto singing one or two solos in addition. The internationalism of the Club was then brought out: Frl. Agnes Harder, a well-known writer, read ari appropriate Christmas legend of her own, in German; this was followed by a humorous French reading ; by an Italian reading, and finally by Miss Arndt’s English recitation, “The Bogies ’11 get you if you don’t watch out*” The Christmas tree, a very pretty one, was lighted up be fore the readings began. A number of pretty girls went round after the re citations with Christmas mementoes (everyone pre sent had brought a trifle) enveloped in mysterious wrappings. Frau Kommerzienrat Heyl then made an appropriate little speech, and called particular atten tion to the “Jung Goethe Fest” which is to be or ganised in a few weeks, under the kind supervision of Director Reinhardt of the Deutsches Theater. The evening* which closed with tea and chat, was a dis tinct success. Hostesses of the occasion were Mrs. Robert-Tor- now, the President of the International Board of the Lyceum Club, and Frl. Marelle. A rather unique entertainment was given by Mr. Mrs. Vernon Spencer on Christmas night, when thirty students and young friends were their first part of the evening was spent in a North Ppfe expedition, the difficulties of which were re presented by a number of original games. The rooms were arranged to resemble a winter-seene, the hostess being attired in' a “Snow Queen” costume, and at tended by three maids, of honour, Misses Clara Wind- augh,. Gertrude Mutton, and Marie Sloss. The Polar trip, though trying, was rendered bear able by the fact that refreshments had been carefully “cached,” and were reached in time. The North Pole, when attained, furnished many surprises, not the least being the fact that it consisted of pop-corn. Musical Hn.

A “cook-stove” found among the many things unearthed supported the suggestion that it was that of Dr. Cook. There was universal dancing following the discovery of the Pole, which was continued until a late hour. Dr. and Mrs. Stanley Darlington, of Boston, who have been enjoying a month’s sojourn at the Hotel Adlon, have left for London in company with Dr. Keyes, who has been doing special work in the Ber lin clinics for some four weeks past. Dr. and Mrs. Darlington and Dr. Keyes were entertained at a fare well dinner at the Hotel Bristol on Christmas night by Dr. G. Edison Matt, of Landshuter Strasse. Mrs. Stillman Kelley had a house-party of Cali fornian friends over the holidays at Tauentzien Str. 19, including Dr. and Miss Jones, the Misses Boalt, Meyer, Angus and Palasche, and Dr. Harries. Amongst the American guests at a most enjoy able Christmas tree entertainment arranged by Frau von Sodenstern, of Tauentzien Strasse 0, were Mrs. Graves, the Directress of the American Woman’s Club, and other members of the Club; Frau Oberst- leutnant von Werner; and Professor Courtland Cooper, of Chicago. Other guests present were Oberstleutenant von Werner and Baron von Rosea. CHURCH SERVICES: BERLIN. St. Georoe’s Church, Monbijou Garten.

PETERSBURG, Thursday.—During the last month there were 174 cases of plague, and 168 deaths from the disease in the Ural territory. CONSTANTINOPLE, Thursday.—During yester day’s session of the Chamber, several Deputies spoke on the resignation of Hilmi Pasha and declared that this step would involve the resignation of the entire Cabinet. Other Deputies represented the Grand Vi zier’s demission as a private matter. The shocking weather which prevailed in the last few days has been responsible for a number of alarm ing incidents, besides playing havoc with communica tion in all parts of the country. According to des patches from Berlin, a winter thunderstorm broke over Berlin on Wednesday afternoon when the warm wind from the south-west suddenly changed into cold and gusty squalls, intermingled with snow flurries. Such velocity was attained by the wind that a scaf fold of wood and iron erected orf the Kaiserin Augusta Allee was torn down and blown right across the street, the debris bringing with it to the ground three electric street-car standards and a tangle of wire, holding-up traffic for two hours. Near the St. Bar tholomew Chnrch a tall tree was uprooted and hurl ed to the ground. Several persons sustained slight injuries in the course of the afternoon. In Saxony the gale, mingled, with snow ancL sleet, attained typhonic velocity on Wednesday afternoon. The Munich-Dresden express had to halt between Oederan and Freiberg owing to several uprooted trees being blown across the line. A number of trees and heavy branches were hurled against the mail van and restau rant car of the express, shattering practically every window on one side. The train arrived in Dresden fifteen minutes late. VIENNA, Thursday.—The Budget provisions form ed the subject of debate in the Herrenhaus yesterday- afternoon. Herr Grabmeyr made a speech in which he touched on the peaceful solution of the annexation crisis, thanks to the loyalty of their German allies, and put forward various suggestions calculated to restore harmony in the Chamber of Deputies. He expressed his appreciation of Baron von Bienerth’s correct, national, and impartial conduct of business, and hoped that the Baron would be attended by good fortune in the future. Discussing the political situa tion, Herr Plehner said the Government’s proposal in regard to the lingual regulations of the State authorities in Bohemia and the division of districts constituted a medium course from which neither of the two contesting parties was very far removed. A State composed of several nationalities could not en dure a national policy whose final aim was racial conflict and mutual destruction (Applause) As in Austria there was no exclusively dominant race, the State itself must, represent the firm and common basis. A strong State, externally and internally, was more necessary in Austria than elsewhere. The en tire national question rested on two simple mutters: the principle of freedom Arid the principle of order; ","nden 68. Reception hours 10-1.—Consul-General: Alexander M.Thadtara, Esq.

Other Deputies represented the Grand Vi zier’s demission as a private matter. The shocking weather which prevailed in the last few days has been responsible for a number of alarm ing incidents, besides playing havoc with communica tion in all parts of the country. According to des patches from Berlin, a winter thunderstorm broke over Berlin on Wednesday afternoon when the warm wind from the south-west suddenly changed into cold and gusty squalls, intermingled with snow flurries. Such velocity was attained by the wind that a scaf fold of wood and iron erected orf the Kaiserin Augusta Allee was torn down and blown right across the street, the debris bringing with it to the ground three electric street-car standards and a tangle of wire, holding-up traffic for two hours. Near the St. Bar tholomew Chnrch a tall tree was uprooted and hurl ed to the ground. Several persons sustained slight injuries in the course of the afternoon. In Saxony the gale, mingled, with snow ancL sleet, attained typhonic velocity on Wednesday afternoon. The Munich-Dresden express had to halt between Oederan and Freiberg owing to several uprooted trees being blown across the line. A number of trees and heavy branches were hurled against the mail van and restau rant car of ","ROME, Thursday.-The Senate yesterday discussed the measures takeH to alleviate the effects of last year’s earthquake. The President recalled the terrible circumstances of the disaster in a moving speech,, and was followed by the new Premier, Signor Sonnino, who declared that he would do all in his power to make good the damage and requested Parliament to grant the necessary means to this end. After the suggested measures had been approved and adopted without debate, the House adjourned sine die."

Speaking yesterday at Brixton on national defence, the Secretary of State for War, Mr. Haldane, said the new General Staff had been hard at work and had completed the plans of coast defence. The whole coast had been divided into sections, and each section assigned to a portion of the territorial army. If an enemy came, he would find troops to oppose hun; who, if they were not strong enough in some places to prevent him from landing, would be strong enough to harass him, to keep him busy, and to check his movements.

Last Wednesday night a clever hoax was per petrated at Caius College, Cambridge. Undergra duates from all the other colleges assembled in the large lecture room to hear Mrs. Carrie Nation, who was advertised to speak on the evils of smoking and drinking. The hall was packed with lively undergraduates, smoking as hard as they could, because they were told that Mrs. Nation objected to smoking. “Mrs. Carrie Nation” addressed the meeting on various topics, but her discourse was disjointed, as the interruptions were extremely frequent. Then the audience discovered that they had been cleverly hoaxed, and that “Mrs. Carrie Nation” was no other than a prominent member of Caius College t in disguise. Some of his friends were bold enough to call him by name, but no jone on the platform moved a muscle, and the original programme was carried through. Eventually the meeting broke up amid dis order, and “Mrs. Carrie Nation” had an interview with the Dean. THE SENATE AND WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. New York, February 26.

New York, February 26. According to a San Francisco telegram, Miss Jennie Crocker, the daughter of the well-known banker, has just been the victim of a smart pieoe of work on the part of a particufarly enterprising thief, she having lost a necklace valued at 50,000 dollars (£10,000), while attending the Mardi Gras ball last Tuesday. How the theft was accomplished Miss Crocker does not know, but up to the present all attempts to trace either the thief or the necklace failed. H. G. B. Peters Furrier 52, Prager Sir.

Article 5 runs: “The Austro- Hungarian Government binds itself to pay to the Ottoman Government, within 15 days of the rati fication of the Protocol, two and a half millions of pounds Turkish in gold as an equivalent for real property owned by the Turkish State in Bosnia and the Herezgovina.” In Article 6 the Austro-Hunga rian Government binds itself, within two years after the ratification of the Protocol, to conclude a com mercial treaty with Turkey on the basis of European international law.

PLOT TO MURDER PRINCE FERDINAND. Belgrade, February 26. The police have today arrested a Bulgarian and a Serb from Sofia on suspicion of intending to mur der Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria. The Bulgarian’s name is Anastasov and the Servian’s Popovitch, and their alleged design was to throw a bomb at prince Ferdinand on his arrival at Rustchuk en route from St. Petersburg to Sofia. Both the prisoners con fessed to being concerned in a grand plot formed in Sofia against the life of the Prince, and declared that they had been deputed to procure at Belgrade the requisite materials for a bomb which were to be conveyed to Rustchuk by a woman. Anastasov describes himself as a student of philosophy and correspondent of a Sofia newspaper; Popovitch says he. came to Belgrade to enrol himself as a Servian volunteer. A judicial enquiry into the case is in progress; and the police are meanwhile search ing for the woman, who, however, is not supposed to be an accomplice. NIPPED IN THE*BUD. Ratibor, February 26.

Latest telegrams from the scenes of the earth quake district are as follow:—Many of the en tombed victims ; at Messina are yet believed to be. alive, and the chief efforts of rescuers are devoted to those points from whence cries for help are heard. Strong measures are being taken against plunderers and ghouls. The British cruiser “Sut lej” has arrived at Messina with the commanding admiral on board. The rest of the British squadron has left for Catania, conveying hundreds of wound ed. It has transpired that the tidal wave which devastated San Giovanni, Calabria, overwhelmed a railway train loaded with passengers, all of whom were killed. Railway communication with Reggio has been restored. Survivors of the disaster who at the moment of the shock were afloat in Messina harbour, relate that they first heard a terrible rumbl ing as of thunder, then a shrill screaming, and at the same instant an enormous wall of water raced up the harbour, overwhelming everything in its path. Rescue work at Messina has now been systematically organised, but results so far are dis couraging. In Reggio, also, the work has been at last properly organised. On Friday the cruiser “Marco Polo” arrived there wfith 100,000 rations and other necessaries. Efforts, are being made tp. convey all survivors away from the ruined centres to places of safety, as it is found that these people invariably collect in crowds and, while too unnerved to be of any use in rescue work, they considerably impede the efforts of more capable workers. The Italian Government and people are deeply impressed by the spontaneity characterising the offers of as sistance which continue to arrive in Rome from all parts of the globe-. The entire Italian press unites in expressing the profound gratitude of the nation for the tokens of humanity and friendship thus displayed. King Victor Emanuel has sent the follow ing telegram to the Premier, Signor Giolitti: “I have visited Canitollo, which is razed to the ground, and Villa San Giovanni, which has suffered equally with Messina. Rescue work has been systematically regulated in Reggio and Canitollo, but enormous difficulties are still to be overcome. It has not rained since Friday morning. The fires at Messina have for the most part been extinguished. Up to now three English and three French ships have arrived.” The King continued his inspection at Messina on Friday, and was deeply moved by the agonising scenes he witnessed. As he passed through the ruined streets the people pressed about him, stretching out their hands for aid. A child, badly injured in the head, threw itself at his feet and begged for bread and water. The King, in a voice broken by emotion, answered: “Help comes; we are all doing what in us lies to alleviate this aw ful catastrophe.” His Majesty has ordered all the warships to distribute their provisions among the starving people. Soldiers are busy night and day erecting temporary barracks out of wood, to give shelter to the victims. The Pope has given 100,000 lire to the relief fund, the Dowager-Queen Margherita 20,000 lire, and the College of Cardinals 20,000 lire towards the same object.

Yesterday’s banquet at the Yildiz palace in honour of the Chamber made a great impression on the deputies. After the dessert, the first Yildiz Secre tary read a speech from the Sultan to the effect that it had given his Majesty much pleasure to dine with the representatives of the Ottoman na tion, and that he believed that the occasion was a happy event in the history of the Ottoman empire. “I give you the assurance,” said the Sultan in one sentence of the speech, “that I will devote my whole soul to upholding the terms of the Consti tution, which guarantees sacred justice.” M. Ach- med Riza, in returning thanks for his Majesty’s hospitality and gracious speech, said it was beyond doubt that, as the Arabs wjould attain to high civi lisation, so also the Ottoman people, united to their Ruler, would take a high place in the civilised world. M. Riza concluded by calling for three cheers for the Sultan, which were heartily given. DIE MIL! RECORD FUND FOR THE RELIEF OF SUFFERERS FROM THE EARTHQAKE IN SICILY AND CALABRIA.

Oestersund, January 1. Two sons of Ml v. Printzold, the first Chamber- lain td the King of Sweden, were frozen to death yesterday during *a ski excursion in the mountains. The oold was intense, the thermometer registering nearly 40 degrees (Fahrenheit) of frost. One of the young men was an officer in the army, the other a student. They were accompanied by a guide, and had nearly reached their destination when their strength failed them. The guide hurried on to get assistance, and soon returned with some men.

Oestersund, January 1. Two sons of Ml v. Printzold, the first Chamber- lain td the King of Sweden, were frozen to death yesterday during *a ski excursion in the mountains. The oold was intense, the thermometer registering nearly 40 degrees (Fahrenheit) of frost. One of the young men was an officer in the army, the other a student. They were accompanied by a guide, and had nearly reached their destination when their strength failed them. The guide hurried on to get assistance, and soon returned with some men. One of the brothers was, however, already dead, and the other died almost immediately. RECORD AEROPLANE^FLIGHT. Ze Mans, January 1. Mr. Wilbur Wright, competing yesterday for the Michelin prize, made 56| rounds in 2 hours 20 mi nutes and 44 seconds, covering in that time a dis tance of 124.3 kilometers (nearly 78 miles), and beating his own record hitherto.

(From our Berlin Correspondent.) A caricature of himself, drawn by one of his col leagues in the American house-building at Messina, and in which the Mayor of Messina figured still more prominently, was one of the “telling” pictures thrown upon the slide on Tuesday evening to illustrate the lecture delivered by Captain Belknap at the American Church. The Mayor of Messina, in his farewell address, eulo gising the work which Captain Belknap had done for the earthquake-shaken city, had indicated that he “wished he had the voice of a siren” to persuade Cap tain Belknap, to remain longer in Messina. The ca ricature showed Captain Belknap, standing with his back towards Italy, on a vessel making seawards. Out of the water near the shore rose the stalwart and bearded figure of the Mayor of Messina, harp in hand, looking longingly after the vanishing naval attache. “O would I could charm the sirens to keep thee, illustrious Cap., in this most unhappy land,” was written beneath the cartoon, which evoked con siderable mirth from the audience in the American Church. The Mayor of Messina had used a high-flown ex pression. But it obviously reflected very sincerely the keen realisation on the part of the Italian author ities of the vast benefit which Captain Belknap and his co-workers, acting for America, had bestowed upon the stricken Italian towns. “The heart of a philan thropist, the soul of an artist/’ was another epithet conferred upon the superintendent of the American relief-work. This phrase might also make some appeal to the American sense of humour, as applied to the building of several hundreds of small and absolutely uniform wooden houses. But it likewise indicates the deeply-felt gratitude of the Italians to whose relief America came, and also forcibly suggests the tact which must have been brought to bear by those un charged with the mission, in everywhere studying, as far as was practicable, the susceptibilities of the Italians. Trees, for example, were left standing by the Americans wherever possible, amongst the groups of white-painted cottages. In Reggio the little build ings were undeniably picturesque, painted white with bright green doors and brick-red foundations. Captain Belknap spent very little time in touching upon the hardships which the work is known to have imposed upon the meii who, headed by himself, sacri ficed themselves and their personal comfort in the interests of unhappy Messina. For several months they lived in the small portable cottages built by themselves ; but while admitting that this was not exactly a life of luxury, Captain Belknap dwelt in no way upon the discomforts endured, except to re mark that the nights might sometimes have been warmer. President Roosevelt’s visit to Messina was an in teresting topic of the lecture. Captain Belknap told how the King of Italy, first putting out to visit the Ex-President in his vessel, then escorted Mr. Roose velt on shore, where the former President of the United States made a thorough inspection of the American relief-work. The enthusiasm of the Italian crowds Captain Belknap described as tremendous. As Mr. Roosevelt drove from point to point their homage amounted to a positive inconvenience. To keep ahead of the crowd was most desirable, but none-the-less difficult, and it frequently became necessary, in pass ing over the wretchedly rough ground, for the ho nourable inmates of the vehicle to dismount in order that good time could be made, out of reach of the enthusiastic Italian populace, ^s Mr. Roosevelt, at the close of his brief visit, made his way back to his boat through the midst of the people, their de light broke all bounds, and taking complete pro prietorship bf him, they cheered wildly with cries of “Our King! Our President!” A suggestive illustration which Captain Belknap showed was that of one of the American-erected buildings with a large bell slung in the trees be hind. This was one of the numerous church-bells which were to be found scattered about the ruins at Messina. The American relief-workers had obtained permission of the Church authorities to utilise this bell for calling the gangs of labourers to their work. When it had for the last time discharged this office it was again to be hung in a Church in Messina, presumably with some fitting inscription describing the novel use to which it had been put. Miss Otis, who has already established dancing classes in Dresden, has now made definite arrange ments for similar classes in Berlin. The classes will be held on Tuesdays. Esthetic (Gilbert) dancing for ladies, from 11-12 o’clock. Social dancing for boys and girls: beginners, 4.30- 5.30; for more advanced pupils, 5.30-6.30. It is desired that on the opening day all pupils in social dancing meet at 4.30.

These are weapons that dirty the hands of their users.—Meanwhile, we must not forget the most important factor in the present struggle,—the with holding of supplies from all the great services. Until this or a new Budget is passed, the Exchequer is theoretically insolvent. Some 25 or 30 millions sterl ing of revenue already collected under the Budget must be refunded if the Bill is rejected. In addi tion to this sum is the deficit which existed at the commencement of the fiscal year) calculated at 15 mil lions. The total sum to be met in the event of a Budget rejection will, therefore, fall not far short of 45 Or 50 million pounds. The gravity of this cir cumstance can hardly be exaggerated, and the respon sibility which the peers are taking upon themselves by holding up the Finance Bill may be accurately guaged therefrom. That many of them are recoiling in horror from the prospect cannot be doubted after the lead given by Lord Cromer, Lord Rosebery, and Lord Balfour of Burleigh. TOKIO (Japan), Friday.—A terrible explosion has occurred in the Onura coal mine, province of Fu kuoka. So far as can be ascertained, fifteen men have lost their lives and 228 others are still entombed in the pit. SCHWERIN, Friday.—Press reports recently cir culated to the effect that the Grand Duchess Alexandra of Mecklenburg-Schwerin anticipates an interesting event in the spring of next year are now officially con firmed. MADRID, Friday.—The War Ministry announces that all is in readiness at Melilla for the resumption operations against the Riff tribesmen, which are ex pected to commence at once. BELGRADE, Friday.—The King of Bulgaria ar rived here yesterday afternoon, and was greeted at the station by King Peter, the Crown Prince, For eign Minister Milovanovitch, and other personages. After introductions among the suites of the two mon- archs had been made, they drove to the palace, not by the direct route, which was strongly guarded by military, but by a roundabout way, at every point of which the people raised hearty cheers. PEKING, Friday.—The Government has issued an edict to the officials of chief towns and provinces by which they are admonished that all measures necessary for the introduction of a constitutional regime within the stated period must be fulfilled in detail. The edict is intended to give the people an assurance that the Regent is determined upon making good all the promises given by the late Emperor Kwangsu. TEHERAN, Friday—The Persian problem has been greatly complicated by a murderous attack updn a caravan in which two Russian Consuls, MM. Passek and Kadlulovsky, were travelling. The attack was made by fifty mounted tribesmen and 200 on foot who belonged to the Kashkai tribe. The escort of the Consular caravan, which was journeying in com pany with six Persian trade caravans, were too weak to withstand the heavy fire poured into them by the marauders, who swarmed on all sides of the iengthy train, and surrender was finally made. The casu alties in the Russian caravan were very heavy, and ten people were also killed among the Persian traders. After surrender had been made the bandits pillaged the caravans of all valuables, and it was only by the greatest effort that the two Consuls, who were un injured, managed to save the archives and money- chest of the Consulate from the thieves. The Russian Minister here has made the strongest representations to the Persian Government, demanding that immediate measures be taken for the punishment of the ma rauders and stating that he will hold the Government responsible for all losses, which must be indemnified. The British Consul at Shiras, as soon as he received news of the outrage, set out for the scene of the fight attended by a doctor and a small escort of Anglo-Indian troops. MADRID, Friday.—An official telegram from Te- neriffe states that the main lava stream from the crater is advancing to the north, after having divided into two branches, one of which flowed two miles in nine hours. Streams of lava pouring down upon Santiago and Tamara have increased their volume. The flight of the populace continues. (From our correspondent.) NEW YORK, Nov. 16. —For the protection of their interests the proprietors of Hampton's Magazine, which has obtained from Commander Peary the right of publishing his North Pole story in serial form on a contract of 50,000 dollars, have insured Peary’s life for the sum of 50,000 dollars. The policy is so arranged that with the completion of each month’s article the amount is reduced by 5,000 dollars. Peary will contribute ten articles in all, so that each article is valued in the contract and in the insurance policy at 5,000 dollars. ST. PETERSBURG, Friday.—The Imperial Senate has revoked the permission granted some days ago by the courts to a woman lawyer, according to which she was admitted to the Bar. The Senate gives as its reason for revoking the sanction that the ad mission of women to the legal profession is a step of high importance, one which must be carefully re gulated by legislation ST. PETERSBURG, Friday.—With reference ,to reports in the foreign press of Russian-American ne gotiations about the expansion of the Amoor railroad and the laying of a second track to the Trans-Siberian Railroad by an American syndicate, your correspondent in this city is authorised to give a categorical denial to the reports, the denial being based on information obtained from the Ministry of Finance and the Min istry of Communications. No negotiations have takbn place, and no such proposals as those suggested have been made. ","2 THE DAILY RECORD, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1909. 1 ' No. 1,157 —■e=e=s B E R CAPTAIN BELKNAP’S LECTURE. (From our Berlin Correspondent.) A caricature of himself, drawn by one of his col leagues in the American house-building at Messina, and in which the Mayor of Messina figured still more prominently, was one of the “telling” pictures thrown upon the slide on Tuesday evening to illustrate the lecture delivered by Captain Belknap at the American Church. The Mayor of Messina, in his farewell address, eulo gising the work which Captain Belknap had done for the earthquake-shaken city, had indicated that he “wished he had the voice of a siren” to persuade Cap tain Belknap, to remain longer in Messina. The ca ricature showed Captain Belknap, standing with his back towards Italy, on a vessel making seawards. Out of the water near the shore rose the stalwart and bearded figure of the Mayor of Messina, harp in hand, looking longingly after the vanishing naval attache. “O would I could charm the sirens to keep thee, illustrious Cap., in this most unhappy land,” was written beneath the cartoon, which evoked con siderable mirth from the audience in the American Church. The Mayor of Messina had used a high-flown ex pression. But it obviously reflected very sincerely the keen realisation on the part of the Italian author ities of the vast benefit which Captain Belknap and his co-workers, acting for America, had bestowed upon the stricken Italian towns. “The heart of a philan thropist, the soul of an artist/’ was another epithet conferred upon the superintendent of the American relief-work. This phrase might also make some appeal to the American sense of humour, as applied to the building of several hundreds of small and absolutely uniform wooden houses. But it likewise indicates the deeply-felt gratitude of the Italians to whose relief America came, and also forcibly suggests the tact which must have been brought to bear by those un charged with the mission, in everywhere studying, as far as was practicable, the susceptibilities of the Italians. Trees, for example, were left standing by the Americans wherever possible, amongst the groups of white-painted cottages. In Reggio the little build ings were undeniably picturesque, painted white with bright green doors and brick-red foundations. Captain Belknap spent very little time in touching upon the hardships which the work is known to have imposed upon the meii who, headed by himself, sacri ficed themselves and their personal comfort in the interests of unhappy Messina. For several months they lived in the small portable cottages built by themselves ; but while admitting that this was not exactly a life of luxury, Captain Belknap dwelt in no way upon the discomforts endured, except to re mark that the nights might sometimes have been warmer. President Roosevelt’s visit to Messina was an in teresting topic of the lecture. Captain Belknap told how the King of Italy, first putting out to visit the Ex-President in his vessel, then escorted Mr. Roose velt on shore, where the former President of the United States made a thorough inspection of the American relief-work. The enthusiasm of the Italian crowds Captain Belknap described as tremendous. As Mr. Roosevelt drove from point to point their homage amounted to a positive inconvenience. To keep ahead of the crowd was most desirable, but none-the-less difficult, and it frequently became necessary, in pass ing over the wretchedly rough ground, for the ho nourable inmates of the vehicle to dismount in order that good time could be made, out of reach of the enthusiastic Italian populace, ^s Mr. Roosevelt, at the close of his brief visit, made his way back to his boat through the midst of the people, their de light broke all bounds, and taking complete pro prietorship bf him, they cheered wildly with cries of “Our King! Our President!” A suggestive illustration which Captain Belknap showed was that of one of the American-erected buildings with a large bell slung in the trees be hind. This was one of the numerous church-bells which were to be found scattered about the ruins at Messina. The American relief-workers had obtained permission of the Church authorities to utilise this bell for calling the gangs of labourers to their work. When it had for the last time discharged this office it was again to be hung in a Church in Messina, presumably with some fitting inscription describing the novel use to which it had been put. Miss Otis, who has already established dancing classes in Dresden, has now made definite arrange ments for similar classes in Berlin. The classes will be held on Tuesdays. Esthetic (Gilbert) dancing for ladies, from 11-12 o’clock. Social dancing for boys and girls: beginners, 4.30- 5.30; for more advanced pupils, 5.30-6.30. It is desired that on the opening day all pupils in social dancing meet at 4.30. Until more satisfactory arrangements can be made the classes will be held in the Victoria Saal, Luther Strasse 31—where Miss Otis can be seen after twelve o’clock by any one desiring to make ar rangements for private lessons.

The fourth annual Winter Sports Meeting was held at Geising on Saturday and Sunday last, the 23rd and 24th of January, under the auspices of (the Dresden Ski Club. Although the snow on the hills where the evnts took place was crusted and hard, the actual weather conditions were very favourable, and all the races were successfully brought off. On Saturday afternoon, the first series of the Bobsleigh-Race, and' a long-distance Military Ski Race were run. For these two events the spectators were not very numerous, as the majority came only for Sunday. In the Bobsleigh trial on Saturday, the “Marabu” (Dresden A.S.C.) made the best time, with Tavel as steerer, and Marcuard at the brake; this race had to be run on the Zinnwalder Road, as the bobsleigh run was not as yet in good condition ; the best time was 4min. for 4 kilometres. The first event on Sunday morning was another Military Ski Race, distance 6 kilometres, won by Gefreiter Viertel, of thje 12th Jager Battalion, in 44min. 45sec. The next event was the Open Ski Race, distance 4 kilometres, won by Ziesche (Tep- litz), time 23min. 53£sec. Then came the Obstacle Ski Race, on a difficult and winding track, wh(ich obliged the competitors to give proof of their effi ciency in the Christiania and Telemark-Swings, the former being used for sharp turning, and the latter for braking; this race was won by Schildbach (Gott- leuba). The last of the ski races was that open to children under 14 years of age, and was won by Fischer (Teplitz), distance 2h kilometres, time 25m£n. 1 Osec. The next three events were the Rodel Races on a run 1 kilometre in length. The first class was for gentlemen on single sleds; the winner of this race was Petzold (Geising), time 38 8 osec. The ladies’ Race was won by Frl. Krumpoldt (Dresden), in 41 sec. The third class was for double sleds, and the winning time, 36sec., was made by Knauth and Otto (Altenberg). In the Steerable Sled Race, the first and third places were won respectively by Collett and Bayer, and von Frenkell and Schou, both teams from the Dresden A.S.C., and both on Norwegian Sjeltke sleds; thie distance was 2 km., and the winning time 3min. 28sec. This was the last of the morning events. The Ski Jumping began at 2 p.m., and drew a very large crowd of spectators. The run before the take-off was between 25 and 30 metres long, and the slope about 25 degrees. This, of course, did not give any opportunity for very remarkable jumping, but very nearly the best possible jump under the circumstances was made. Six competed, only two of whom lost their balance at all out of three jumps each. As was to be expected, the best showing was made by the three Norwegians who entered the competition, and Oskar Blich (Dresden A.S.C.), champion ski-runner of Saxony, won with a jump of 15 metres, Jespersen being second with an 11 metre jump. The event was closed with an exhibition double-jump of 17 metres by Julius and Oskar Blich, who took the landing incline hand in hand, stopping at the end with an exceedingly well executed Telemark Swing. , The final event was the second series of .the Bobsleigh Race, run on the regular bob-track, two kilometres in length. The curves were sharp and the run fast,—conditions which necessitated expert steering and frequent application *of the brakes. The “Jockel” (Dresden A.S.C.) made the best time, with Wichmann steering and Jacobi at the brake; the “Marabu” was a close second. The latter, however, having made a better average time for the two series, won the first place. HUMAN FLOTSAM. The Captain advises those who wish to study the lowest dregs of the earth, to give the slums of London a rest, and watch the throngs who besiege the office of the agents who undertake to supply the cattle boats with “help” at Montreal. German and Russian Jews, Dukhiobors, Italians, negroes; broken-down “sharks” and “confidence men” from the large cities of the United* States ; one-time money ed youths from the larger English towns, who in a single month (or less) in New York, Montreal, or Toronto have run through the capital given them to start up in business, and are returning on the off-chance of getting more. All bustling and hustling each other after the same prize—a free passage to London, the home, and often the grave, of the desperate. —i— “FEAR AND SAVOY NEVER MEET.” King Victor Emmanuel’s happiness is distinctly of the domestic type. But although he is quiet, fond of his wife and children, and decidedly com monplace in his tastes, personal bravery is wonder fully marked in his character, and whenever danger has overtaken his people—such as the earthquake that has shocked the entire world recently—he has been the first to arrive on the scene of devastation or illness The motto of his great house is firmly graven on his heart, and over and over again he has shown that “Fear and Savoy never meet.” CHURCH SERVICES: DRESDEN.

The fourth annual Winter Sports Meeting was held at Geising on Saturday and Sunday last, the 23rd and 24th of January, under the auspices of (the Dresden Ski Club. Although the snow on the hills where the evnts took place was crusted and hard, the actual weather conditions were very favourable, and all the races were successfully brought off. On Saturday afternoon, the first series of the Bobsleigh-Race, and' a long-distance Military Ski Race were run. For these two events the spectators were not very numerous, as the majority came only for Sunday. In the Bobsleigh trial on Saturday, the “Marabu” (Dresden A.S.C.) made the best time, with Tavel as steerer, and Marcuard at the brake; this race had to be run on the Zinnwalder Road, as the bobsleigh run was not as yet in good condition ; the best time was 4min. for 4 kilometres. The first event on Sunday morning was another Military Ski Race, distance 6 kilometres, won by Gefreiter Viertel, of thje 12th Jager Battalion, in 44min. 45sec. The next event was the Open Ski Race, distance 4 kilometres, won by Ziesche (Tep- litz), time 23min. 53£sec. Then came the Obstacle Ski Race, on a difficult and winding track, wh(ich obliged the competitors to give proof of their effi ciency in the Christiania and Telemark-Swings, the former being used for sharp turning, and the latter for braking; this race was won by Schildbach (Gott- leuba). The last of the ski races was that open to children under 14 years of age, and was won by Fischer (Teplitz), distance 2h kilometres, time 25m£n. 1 Osec. The next three events were the Rodel Races on a run 1 kilometre in length. The first class was for gentlemen on single sleds; the winner of this race was Petzold (Geising), time 38 8 osec. The ladies’ Race was won by Frl. Krumpoldt (Dresden), in 41 sec. The third class was for double sleds, and the winning time, 36sec., was made by Knauth and Otto (Altenberg). In the Steerable Sled Race, the first and third places were won respectively by Collett and Bayer, and von Frenkell and Schou, both teams from the Dresden A.S.C., and both on Norwegian Sjeltke sleds; thie distance was 2 km., and the winning time 3min. 28sec. This was the last of the morning events. The Ski Jumping began at 2 p.m., and drew a very large crowd of spectators. The run before the take-off was between 25 and 30 metres long, and the slope about 25 degrees. This, of course, did not give any opportunity for very remarkable jumping, but very nearly the best possible jump under the circumstances was made. Six competed, only two of whom lost their balance at all out of three jumps each. As was to be expected, the best showing was made by the three Norwegians who entered the competition, and Oskar Blich (Dresden A.S.C.), champion ski-runner of Saxony, won with a jump of 15 metres, Jespersen being second with an 11 metre jump. The event was closed with an exhibition double-jump of 17 metres by Julius and Oskar Blich, who took the landing incline hand in hand, stopping at the end with an exceedingly well executed Telemark Swing. , The final event was the second series of .the Bobsleigh Race, run on the regular bob-track, two kilometres in length. The curves were sharp and the run fast,—conditions which necessitated expert steering and frequent application *of the brakes. The “Jockel” (Dresden A.S.C.) made the best time, with Wichmann steering and Jacobi at the brake; the “Marabu” was a close second. The latter, however, having made a better average time for the two series, won the first place. HUMAN FLOTSAM. The Captain advises those who wish to study the lowest dregs of the earth, to give the slums of London a rest, and watch the throngs who besiege the office of the agents who undertake to supply the cattle boats with “help” at Montreal. German and Russian Jews, Dukhiobors, Italians, negroes; broken-down “sharks” and “confidence men” from the large cities of the United* States ; one-time money ed youths from the larger English towns, who in a single month (or less) in New York, Montreal, or Toronto have run through the capital given them to start up in business, and are returning on the off-chance of getting more. All bustling and hustling each other after the same prize—a free passage to London, the home, and often the grave, of the desperate. —i— “FEAR AND SAVOY NEVER MEET.” King Victor Emmanuel’s happiness is distinctly of the domestic type.

THE DAILY RECORD. FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 1909. □I DRESDEN The ice-festival on the Carola See, which was ori ginally to have taken place on the 9th of January but vyas postponed in consequence of weather condi tions, is announced for tomorrow (Saturday), from 1.30 to 6 p.m. The festival has been arranged by the Dresden Johannes-Verein, under the patronage of H.R.H. Princess Johann Georg, and the charitable work of this organisation among needy women and children is too well known to call for further com mendation. Apart from its benevolent and deserving object, however, the Festival will present sufficient attractiveness of its own to warrant a record at tendance. Royalty has promised to attend the event, and for the occasion the Carola See, always a po pular skating resort, will be brilliantly decorated and illuminated. A concert will be held during the en tire afternoon, and other attractive features will be: figure-skating, a costume quadrille, children’s amuse ments, a Chinese lantern procession, and a ladies’ hat competition. The three ladies whose hats receive the largest number of votes will be awarded a mark of distinction. Refreshments will be provided in the adjacent restaurant, in addition to which buffets will, be erected on the rink, presided over by ladies and gentlemen of the Committee. The remarkably reasonable prices of admission are another feature, viz. one mark for adults and 50 pfg. for children! For a highly enjoyable way of spending tomorrow afternoon we can recommend this Festival to our readers. Further particulars appear in the adver tisement on page four. The Baden-Baden Church Magazine for January contains a reproduction of the address presented to the Rev. T. Archibald S. White, M.A., bv his con gregation last year, on the conclusion of forty years’ Ministry, thirty-seven of which have been passed at Baden. It speaks in appreciative terms of the unceasing endeavours on the part of the popular chaplain to beautify the church and generally add to its prosperity. We also learn from the magazine that Her Royal Highness the Grand Duchess Louise of Baden graciously presented the Chaplain with a framed portrait of H.R.H. the late Grand Duke Frederick of Baden, and that H.R.H. the Grand Duke of Baden conferred the insigna of the Order of the Lion of Zaehringen (First Class) upon the Rev. Mr. White. J The fourth Symphony Concert, series B, will not take place on Friday, the 29th instant, but on Mon day, February 1.—The cast of Richard Strauss’ music- drama “Salome,” on Tuesday, the 26th instant, will be as follows. Herodes, Herr Sembach (for the first time); Herodias, Frl. Eibenschiitz; Salome, Frau Aino Ackte, from Paris; Jochanaan, Herr Perron ; Narraboth, Herr Soot; Herodias' page, Frau Bender- Schafer; Jews, Herren Rudiger, Wolf I., Grosch, Erl, Rains; Nazarenes, Herren Hummel and Biissel; Soldiers, Herren Nebuschka and Puttlitz; Cappado- cian, Herr Wachter ; Herodes’ page, Frl. Keldorfer. Elena Gerhardt and Professor Arthur Nikisch gave their last concert of this season at the Vereinshaus on Wednesday. They must be named togethejr, be cause I have never found two artist-natures which were so fully complementary to each other as are these two; and because the endless charm that pro ceeds from one of them is reflected in the other, stimulating and intensify/(ng hfs or her art. Both parties thus gain. Elena Gerhardt never sings more beautifully than when she is accompanied by Pro fessor Nikisch; the latter never plays more impres sively than when her singing inspires him. And so it is natural that a concert given by these two gifted artists should by degrees come to be reckoned a great day in Dresden. It is so in fact, as such refined and luminous art as they exhibit compen sates for much of an inferior kind that a long con cert season produces.—Elena Gerhardt was not at her best on Wednesday, as she had hardly recovered from a severe cold; but hell mastery in things tech nical enabled her to veil her indisposition. Only at the beginning wasl a slight hoarseness noticeable; and in Wagner’s melancholy song “Im Treibhause” —which has historical interest as having been one of the composer’s studies for “Tristan und Isolde”— she was unable quite successfully to manage the subtle high notes required. The deepest impres sions were made by the singer with the “Sapphische Ode” of Brahtns and by Reger’s wonderful song, “Des Kindes Gebet.” The crowded hall rang with applause, and the audiencb slowly dispersed after listening to several extra numbers.

To begin with the Far East, the Irma Company from Bur- mah, never yet seen in Europe, will celebrate their mystic rites under the leadership of their chief Big wig, before the “Jungbrunnen” in a monumental temple-court. Round about the image of the goddess quiet alcoves will invite retirement from the noipe of the revels without and afford rest and refresh ment to exhausted devotees. For the Pitti-Pooti Geisha Troupe from Japan, a genuine Japanese tea house with mats will be erected opposite the “Jung brunnen,” and here, in addition to Geisha dances, will be seen break-neck performances by Japanese acrobats. From the platform of the tea-house his Royal Highness Prince Johann Georg will receive the homage of the festive processionists. His Ma jesty King Friedrich August intends to visit the “Festwiese” after the performance of “Egmont.” The Nigger Company, Limited, is to have the ho nour of producing before his Majesty their original native dances, in which the taming of wild natures by the power of music will be demonstrated. For the troupe, which travels with its own riding ele phant and native orchestra—30 persons, including the elephant—a negro village will be built, with a bar for the sale of double-alcoholic date-juice (D.R.G.M.). Hard by the negro village the Balkan folk, in their gipsy tents, will tap the native “Slivovi)tz.” (This company, on its business card, warrants it self “chemisch frisch gereinigt.”). Between the Bal kans and Africa the cavaliers and dames of Europe will be tempted to indulge in equestrian exercise and feats in the “Concours Hippique” of a merry- go-round that goes straight (on a new system), in competition with whjch the “Tombola” w^ll turn its Wheel of Fortune. Opposite the Tombola' temple a “Concess. Priv. Standesamt” will, for a moderate fee, unite (or separate, according to agreement) couples for the term of the “Fest.” (The “Standes- amt” is provided with an urgency exit, in case of need.). In the village inn (“The Landlady of the Limes”) the rousing Opera Troupe “Salome” will produce their newest hit: “Elektra at its first per formance.” This will be wound up several times. The entirely new scenery and fitting-up is impreg nated against Feuersnot with “symphonia domes- tica.” The supply of self-baked Strauss cakes will suffice for a whole week. (A Mozart Cycle may be looked for!) The. Seven Swabians have set up a “Stammtisch” in the garden of the country inn; the Italians hold themselves apart in their own “Osteria,” a charmingly picturesque building (of thoroughly safe construction). The “Dresdner Ball-Salon” will afford the highest degree of comfort; an “Aunt Sally” in which for a very moderate payment all comers may have a shy at the greatest of Dresden’s cocoa-nuts—“Guild” and Society members pay the same price—will wage fierce competition w,ith a shooting-booth where paintings, works of art created specially for the “Fest,” may be shot at. (An ap plication to the Reichstagsdirektion for the use of the removed Jank frescoes failed because of the inordinate demands of that authority).

No. 898. □ BERLIN This is par excellence a week of Court festivities, and Unter den Linden is unusually gay with gorgeous State- carriages supported by be-silvered footmen. The fanfare of royal automobiles rushing to or from the Schloss is becoming almost fatiguingly common. On Tuesday afternoon the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess received in audience the newly ap pointed Ambassador for Great Britain and Lady Goschen. Shortly before this audience the Crown Princess had received the American Ambassador and Mrs. Hill. Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Orr, who to the regret of many Berlin friends were lately transferred from the American Embassy in Berlin to London, will arrive at the end of this week for a few days’ visit to Mr. and Mrs. Joseph C. Grew. Mr. Grew is Second Secretary at the American Embassy in Berlin. Brilliant illuminations by Bengal lijghts are to beautify Unter den Linden on the evening of Ja nuary 27, the fiftieth anniversary of the Kaiser’s birthday. The illuminations wjill probably commence at eight o’clock and last an hour. The Royal School of Art Needlework has for warded a splendid collection of exhibits to the Bri tish Section of the Lyceum Club “People’s Art Ex hibition.” Interesting old country smocks and sun- bonnets, patch-work quilts, portieres, etc., are in cluded, also a beautiful curtain worth 2,000 marks. All are for sale. A collection of Irish lace has also arrived, just too late, unfortunately, to be exa mined by the Empress, whose great love of beauti ful needlework would have rendered it of especial interest to her. The Kaiserin, by the way, said many admiring things about the North Bucks lace exhibit in the English Section, and jjn the Winder- mere weaving exhibit of Miss A. Garnett, who has all her silks dyed in the colours of flowers and shrubs and in sunset shades. Already at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, the first day on which it was thrown open to the public, the saleswomen at the Exhibition began to find them selves in requisition. Little groups of buyers, con tinually increasing in number, moved from sedjibn to section and from booth to booth in search of foreign curiosities, artistic and useful. Throughout the next month people will be able to buy here in Berlin all sorts of articles which they must other wise rummage in all the odd corners of Europe to find. Mr. A. F. P. Hayman and Mr. J. A. Ford have been appointed Trustees of the St. George’s Church Endowment Fund, in the place of Mr. Bashford and Mr. Bynnes, lately deceased. Mrs. Hessenberg, Kurfiirsten Strasse 128, enter tained on Monday afternoon at a small tea for M. Kriebitz German lessons. Highly recommended by English , teachers in Berlin. At home 3—4 Wilmersdorf. Wilhelmsaue 118. young people in honour of Miss Gladys Holling- worth, who was in Berlin for a few days passing through with her father, one of the Directors of the Paris Westinghouse Company. Miss Eda Heinemann gave a short dramatic pro gramme at the home of Mrs. A. M. Thackara on Tuesday evening, and invited a number of her friends. Miss Heinemann was attractively dressed in Japanese costume, the^ impromptu stage being also appropri ately decorated. “Mrs. Dot,” Somerset Maugham’s popular comedy, was reproduced in German at the Schauspielhaus on Tuesday night, and continues to win the approba tion of Berlin playgoers. It is confidently expected that it will have a lengthy run. Berliners find the English comedy very similar to a German “Lust- spielschwank,” and assert that its name is the most foreign thing about it. . Frl. von Mayburg is said to give a splendid pre sentation of Mrs. Dot, the rich widow of a brewer, who is in love with the too-correct Gerald Halstane, who in turn is in love with Mrs. Dot. Mr. Halstane, however, has quite by mistake become engaged to a' pretty unsophisticated girl, to whom he considers himself bound. The three acts of the play depict Mrs. Dot's (finally successful) endeavours to instil common-sense into Mr. Halstane and cause him to break his engagement with the “junges Ganschen,” to use the German critic’s term, and marry Mrs. Dot herself. Another English play presented in Berlin the other day is one of a very different type, whose name alone breathes melodrama in its most thrilling form. “Das Madchen auf Irrwegen” (“The Girl that Wreck ed his Home”) is one of Walter Melville’s well- known sensational dramas, which apparently take well with a certain section of the Berlin public. “The Girl that Wrecked,” etc., is considerably less blood-curdling than some of Melville’s melodrama that have been staged at the Luisen Theater. There is, indeed, only one murder, and the sensational ele ment is fairly well toned down, some scenes containing a certain amount of charm and humour. The young German translator and manager, Siegfried Lutz, was called before the curtain several times, and was presented with two fine wreaths, one of them in scribed “From the British Dramatic Association, to their Esteemed Champion in Germany.” Miss Cecilia Greenwood, of Princeton, 111., S is a guest at Pension Belmont, Victoria Louisen Platz 10, where her mother and sister are also staying. Miss Greenwood was a member of Dr. Babcock’s party to Russia. Mr. and Mrs. E. G. Wyckoff, of Ithaca, who are staying at Pension von Heuckelum, also took part in the Russian study trip.

Senor Paul, the Venezuelan Envoy Extraordinary, has stated to a representative of Reuter’s Agency that the fall of ex-Kresident Castrof was brought about by the people. Venezuela’s dispute with the outer world was represented to be of a dangerous nature by the ex-President, as he wished to avert revolution against his own adminifstratijon. Senor Paul added that it was his hope this week to for mulate and sign a protocol re-establishing official relations between Venezuela and the Netherlands. This done, it is his intention to visl Great Bri tain, Germany, and Italy, for the purpose of per forming similar work with regard to these countries. In conclusion, the Envoy remarked that outstand ing questions between his own land and the United States would be settled in an amicable spirit, so far as that was possible. THE SERVIAN GOVERNMENT. NO NEW MINISTRY FORMED. Belgrade, January 21. It is officially reported that the Premier tendered the resignation of the Ministry on the 15th instant coupled with the expressed wish that a new' Mi nistry should be formed that would enjoy more decided support from Parliament. The King ac cepted the resignations conditionally, and at the same time gave bis consent to the opening of negotiations for the formation of a new Cabinet. These nego tiations having now proved unsuccessful, the King informed the Premier this morning that he could not accept the resignations of the Ministry, and assured him of his continued confidence. THE DUKE OF THE ABRUZZI. SENSATIONAL RUMOURS DENIED. Rome, January 21. The semi-official Giornale d' Italia deals with the rumours circulated in the foreign press as to the pending resignation of the Duke of the Abruzzi from the Italian Navy and his intention to renounce his rank as a.member of the Royal Family in order to become a private citizen. The journal characterises these rumours as fantastic inventions, and also con tradicts the reports of differences between the Duke and jiis brother, the Duke d’ Aosta. The fact is, according to this journal, that the Duke of the Abruzzi is about to undertake a tour of exploration in the Himalayas, and that his projected visit to London is in connection with this project. THE TURKISH BOYCOTT MOVEMENT. Constantinople, January 20. The Minister of the Interior has stated that he received the members of the Boycott Committee to day and recommended them to put an end to the boycott on Austrian goods. The same advice was given by the Grand Vizier, who also received the Committee. The members of the Committee replied that they were ready to follow the Ministers’ ad vice. The boycott of Bulgarian goods continues. TRAGIC DEATH IN A BALLROOM. Carlsruhe, January 21. The Governor of the castle, Offensandt von Berck- holtz, last night met his death under particularly tragic circumstances.

No. 910. BERLIN It is interesting to note that until King Edward arrives next Tuesday, no English king will have been in x Berlin since 1723,—a period of 185 years. The last visit was paid by King George the First, who arrived in Berlin on October 8, 1723, to ne gotiate with his son-in-law, King Friedrich Wilhelm the First, with regard to a double marriage between members of their respective families. Considerable disgust has been felt among Ber liners at the moist weather—rain and thaw—which has had the upper hand in Berlin during the past few days. With the approaching visit of the King and Queen so close at hand, wet weather becomes a serious obstacle to progress in decorating the city. Flag masts, festoon posts, tribunes, etc., can if ne cessary be erected during an incessant downfall of rain; but the millions of paper roses which, at the Emperor's wish, are to make Berlin blossom into sudden spring in honour of King Edward, will look somewhat dejected if they encounter anything like the weather of the past few days. The fact that these garland decorations are to extend over such a long tract of thoroughfare will make it ne cessary to commence betimes with their adjustment. Hence the strong desire on the part of the Berlin authorities for a continued spell of dry weather prior to the visit of the King. The Royal visit to Berlin’s city hall (“das Rote Haus”) is now definitely fixed to take place on Wednesday, February 10, at 12 noon. The visit will probably last three quarters of an hour. At 1 o’clock on Wednesday the King will take lunch at the British Embassy. Tribunes for a favourable view of the entry of the King and Queen are being erected by the em ployes of the Royal Theatres outside the “Prinzessin- nen-Palais.” Tickets may be obtained from the Por- tier of the Royal Schauspielhaus.

The Emperor was soon on the spot, and remained there half an hour. One fireman became insensible and was carried off to hospital. Several more men succumbed later to the fumes. CHURCH SERVICES: BERLIN. Mrs. Arthur N. Davis will be hostess at the re gular Club tea tomorrow* (Saturday) from 4 to 5 p.m. Vocal numbers will be rendered by Miss Graves. Sundays: The generous sum of #1,500 has been donated to the American Church by a member of the congrega tion, for the purpose of improving the organ, which will be reconstructed so that it will be a three manual instrument. The amount given makes it pos sible to enlarge the organ so that it will meet all the requirements of the Church, and the rebuilt instrument will, it is expected, add very materially to the attractiveness of the musical services. The work will be finished about the end of April. 11 a.m. 6 p.m Fridays: 11 a.m Holy Days: 9 a.m S. George’s Church, Monbijou Garten.

Schaefer, American guests at the Hotel Adlon, left on Wednesday for Dresden, whence they will go to Nice for a several weeks’ stay. That important element of the British Colony, the English governesses and teachers of English in Ber lin, are feeling some dissatisfaction over the fact that a place of honour in the deputation to present an address of welcome to the King was not accorded to the well-known Directress of the British and American Governesses’ Home in Berlin, Miss Lake, who for the past ten years has been the best friend and untiring representative of the interests of the hundreds of British governesses who settle in Berlin. It is suggested that Miss Lake, as the chief re presentative of such a very representative section of the British community, would, even though a lady, have been most appropriate as a member of the deputation. Miss Lake, it is felt, miiight at least have been accorded the privilege of herself declining to serve upon the deputation. Americans recently registered at the Hotel Adlon include :— Chas. S.

Sup pose we undertake to pay you a yearly allowance on the sole condition that you guarantee effectu ally to frustrate all attempts on the life of His Majesty the Czar; how would that be? Your pafty would lose little, for the chances of your success are very remote at best, and you personally would gain what we will regularly pay you. Shall we let it be a bargain?” Presumably some such co venant as this was struck up between the guardians of the Czar and the criminals thirsting for his life. ACCIDENT TO THE CROWN PRINCE OF SERVIA. Belgrade, February 3. The automobile of the Crown Prince ran at full speed this afternoon against a lamp-post. The Crown Prince himself was steering, and was slightly in jured in the face, THE UNREST IN BOHEMIA. Vienna, February 3. At today’s sitting of the Lower House, Freiherr Dr. Bienerth, the Austrian Premier, spoke as fol lows: “We have reached a serious crisis. A de cision must be come to, whether the national dis cord in Bohemia, which weighs like a nightmare on the country, throwing not only the political ma chinery but trade and commerce and all civil work out of order, shall drag on like a chronic disease, pr be so far mastered that undisturbed government and a permanent and profitable co-operation of the parties in Parliament with the Government shall be rendered possible. In the conviction that only a law can produce peace, that the clearness and explicitness of law must take the place of ambiguous regulations and arbitrary interpretations, the Go vernment appeals to the Legislature as an Absolute arbitrator, while endeavouring to limit the subjects ■of dispute by selecting the most urgent and ma ture. .... There are no longer any irreconcilable dif ferences; the only thing needed, in order to attain the desired object, is the disposition for peace. The proposals of the Government embrace, so to speak, the whole balance of the contests which have been carried on hitherto; they are based on the results of the attempts which have been made to bring the national parties nearer together The settle ment to which a way is opened by the law will at all events be better than the unsettlement which has prevailed till ,now.” THE EARTHQUAKE DISASTER. AID FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. New York, February 3.

THE DAILY RECORD, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1909. Ell We are requested by the Committee of the Royal Academy to state that the report published by a Dresden contemporary of the amount cleared at the Gauklerfest, is absolutely erroneous, and most like ly emanated from some totally unauthenticated and probably malicious source. The actual amount is at the most perhaps half the sum stated in that report, and would then cover the trouble and loss of time incurred by the members of the Academy in arranging and decorating the hall. As a matter of fact the students themselves not only do all the preparatory work, which takes months, but are also their own carpenters and upholsterers in pre paring the Ausstellungs-Palast for their Fete. This year all instruction in the Academy was suspended for a week, in order to enable the students to de vote all their time and energy to the work of de corating the halls. It is only by such devotion to their task that the students can gain their object of clearing a sum of money for the purpose of maintaining the Mensa Academica, and of adding to a capital fund the interest of which is in future to relieve the students of their strenuous task of providing sufficient money to cover current expenses. At present it is not possible to gain any accurate idea as to the actual sum cleared, as not all the bills have been rendered. We regret that, by a printer’s error, the date of Mr. Percy Sherwood’s coming concert was given in our number of yesterday as the 25th instant. The concert will take place at the Palmengarten on Fri day, the 26th instant, and the programme will com prise exclusively compositions by the concert-giver, in the performance of which he will be assisted by Herren Petri, Wille, and Spitzner. Next Sunday, at 5 p.m., Frl. Helga Petri will appear for the first time before the Dresden pub lic in a charity concert at the “Reformierte Kirche.” Assisted by her father, Prof. Petri, she will sing arias for soprano to the violin accompaniment by J. S. Bach. Prof. Petri will also play the Largo from the suite by Max Reger, and Herr Alfred Sittard render on the organ the Preludes and Fugues in B-minor and D-flat by Bach, as well as Reger’s D-minor “Tricate.” The sudden change of weather has put a damper upon the pursuit of winter sports, much to the dis gust of the many local enthusiasts. It has now been raining more or less incessantly since Wednes day morning, and at this rate the last traces of snow will soon disappear. Besides disappointing pleasure seekers, this sudden thaw is the cause of serious loss to all such who depend upon cold weather for their living. The late director of the Sachsische Maschinenfab- rik, Chemnitz, who had been arrested at Ismailia, Egypt, on the charge of forgery, has, according to a report of the Chemnitz Allgemeine Zeitung eluded his warders at Genoa on his way back to Germany. j An order issued by the Imperial Chancellor and published in the Reichsgesetzblatt of the 9th of January, 1909, is of special interest and importance DRESDEN I (pupil Mrs. Helen Best, London) Specialist for Treatments of the Face, Neck and for Superfluous Hair.—Manicure.— Racknitz Strasse 14, p.

The said order declares that the protection of patterns for use, of patterns, and of models, provided by the Imperial law of the 18th of March, 1904, shall apply also to the International Photographic Exhibition of Dresden, 1909. That law prescribes that inventions, patterns for use, patterns, and models shown at a home or foreign Exhibition, and trade-marks dis played on goods so exhibited, shall enjoy temporary protection, with the effect that the exhibition, or other use or later publication of the* invention, pat tern, or trade-mark, shall not bar the obtainment of a legal patent or protection of a pattern or trade mark, provided that the application for such patent or protection is made by the exhibitor or his lawful successor within six months from the date of the opening of the Exhibition. Such applications will take precedence of applications sent in by non-ex hibitors after the day on which the Exhibition be gan. These provisions are most important to ex hibitors who intend to show inventions that have not been previously made public but wish to be protected against unwarranted imitations.

The public are hereby informed of the arrange ments of the Fundamt, and in particular that it is advisable to enquire for lost articles frequently within twelve months after the loss. Finders of articles are reminded that they are com pelled by law to give immediate notice of the finding of any article of the value of from three marks up wards, at the Fundamt or at the office of the Police district in which the finder resides. It is urgently recommended that the loser of an article should make enquiry at the Fundamt per sonally, and not by a deputy who is insufficiently and perhaps not at all acquainted with the lost property. m Special lost property offices are established: . for the tram-lines at Georg Platz 5; . ‘ for the omnibuses at Werder Strasse 35; and at the Hauptbahphof.

Elektra’s father (Agamemnon) has been murdered by her mother's (Clytemnestra's) lover (Aegisth). She broods over her sole aim in life, viz. that her brother (Orest), whose whereabouts are unknown, should revenge their father by killing his murderers. In the opening scene five maids"" discuss Elektra’s misery, only one takes her mistress's part, and she is being .chastised for her allegiance when Elektra enters. She is joined by her sister (Chrysothemis), who exhorts her to abandon her revengeful bearing, which is causing Clytem nestra to keep both her daughters in captivity. The mother appears with her followers, in a threatening mood. Dismissing her suite, she endeavours to per suade Elektra to tell her what sacrifice is necessary in order to banish the apparitions with which she is incessantly haunted. Elektra declares that a woman must be sacrificed, and that woman must be Clytemnestra herself. The mother's alarm at such a probability is appeased by the entrance of her confidante, who whiskers to her that Orest, her son, is dead. Elektra vainly implores her sister to join her in accomplishing the destruction of their mother and her lover. The attempt is abortive, whereupon Elektra, in despair, resolves to carry out the deed herself. With her own hands she unearths the axe with which her father was slain, and while engaged in this act is surprised by a stranger, whom she eventually recognises as her brother, Orest. Entering the house he kills his mother and her lover, Aegisth. While the domestic retainers are giving vent to their joy at the return of Orest, Elektra, who has been in strumental in bringing about the destruction of the sinful usurpers, falls to the ground, lifeless.

No. 910. AIRSHIP PASSENGER SERVICE. ARRANGEMENTSJPROORESSINO. The proposal for the establishment of a regular airship passenger service in Germany appears to be on the way to realisation. According to the Hamburg f'remdenblatt, the Zeppelin Airship Com pany has expressed its willingness to make Frankfort its headquarters for extensive trips with passengers down the Rhine to Diisseldorf, and up stream to Lake Constance. The company stipulates that if it does this a balloon hall, in the vicinity of Frank fort, shall be erected on the lines of Count Zep pelin’s shed at Manzell. Diisseldorf is prepared to build a station for airships coming down the Rhine valley. The Fremdenblatt also learns on good author ity that Hamburg may possibly become a terminal of one of the airship routes, and on Monday the docks at the Blohm and Voss Wharf were inspected on behalf of the Zeppelin Company, with a view to ascertaining if they would be suitable for the erection of a balloon hall. Count Zeppelin and Major von Parsefal, exponents of the rigid and non-rigid airship principles respectively, have ac cepted invitations to attend the Frankfort Airship Exhibition, which will be held from July 10 to October 10. They will travel in their airships to the exhibition from Friedrichshafen and Bitterfeld respectively, and will make show trips with pas sengers around the exhibition. AUSTRIAN OFFICER’S AMAZING SUICIDE. Vienna, February 3. Lieut. Stankewicz, a young Army officer, has com mitted suicide under terrible circumstances at Przemysl (Galicia). He saturated the furniture of his room with naphtha, which he also poured over the floor, and he placed on the carpet a number of ball cartridges. Then he fired the room in several places, so that in a few minutes it was converted into a veritable furnace, and finally hurled him self into the midst of the flames. The smoke and a series of violent explosions alarm ed the neighbours, who hastened to help in extin guishing the fire, but when it was possible to enter the house, only the ashes of the lieutenant were to be found. THE U.S. TREASURY DEFICIT. Washington, February 3. The Treasury returns for January, which have just been issued, show that the State deficit during that month increased by sixteen million dollars. The total deficit for the fiscal year to date is 79,814,443dols., which is the largest for many years. RUSSIA’S ACTION IN THE NEAR EA8T. St. Petersburg, February 4. In some foreign journals the inference has been drawn from Russia’s offer to make herself finan cially responsible for the compensation payable by Bulgaria to Turkey, that the Russian Government, in making the offer, had in view the realisation of her own particular plans,—for instance, the solution of the. Dardanelles question in favour of Russia. The St. Petersburg Telegraphic Agency is authorised to state in the most positive manner that the said offer was made solely for the sake of preserving peace, and that the Russian Government has no in tention,.of attaching to the offer any condition what ever concerning the Dardanelles question or any other particular object. ■ ■ DRESDEN Pension Cronheim, Strasse 47, corner of MUnchner Strasse.

Two Bills were before the Legisla ture, one rendering it illegal for Asiatics to own land in the State, and the other providing that se parate schools shall tie provided for Japanese scho lars. Governor Gillett, at the urgent request of President Roosevelt, has undertaken to veto both in the event of their being passed, and this has greatly exasperated leading Californians, and. has served to inflame local public opinion still further. As will be seen by the despatch published be low, however, the land Bill has been rejected by the Legislature, and this is a welcome sign that common sense is reasserting itself over the passions of racial animosity. President Roosevelt is reported to have said that he would not attempt to interfere if the Bills were honestly directed against all alien immigrants. As a matter of fact, he recently declared that there is less need to legislate against the Japanese than against any other nationality, because the number of them coming into North America is d(imj|nishing every month. Statistics just issued by the U.S. De partment of Commerce and Labour certainly seem to confirm the President’s statement, and it has fur ther transpired that for some time past the Tokio Government has voluntarily kept the Department ad vised of the departure of emigrants for the United States, and has in other ways shown that it has no desire at all that its people should go to for eign lands, when there is ample scope for their energies in Corea and Formosa. The Californians, however, according to a con temporary’s New. York correspondent, still maintain that the number of Japanese in the State is steadi ly growing, thousands gaining entrance over the Mexican border in the course of every year, while the official statistics are compiled merely from the arrivals at the ports. Sacramento, February 3. The Legislative Assembly has rejected, by 48 votes to 28, the Bill prohibiting the acquisition of land by foreigners, which was directed against the Ja panese.

PEHS10H BEHNCKE The matinee hat was bound to reach Russia, and ft has managed to penetrate into the provinces, ac- the St. Petersburg correspondent of a contemporary. The other evening a lady, an officer’s wife, sat in the front row of the parterre of the Novgorod theatre. The lady was wearing a hat which measured fifty-six inches across. Fifteen people craned their necks in a vain attempt to catch even a glimpse of the stage ; in vain they besought the lady to remove the offending hat. At last a police man was called in; he told the lady that she had made herself “a public nuisance,” and he summoned her to appear next morning at the local police-court. She was fined a small sum, and warned against wearing such a jjnonstrous hat, at least in the theatre. AVALANCHE overwhelms a diligence. Berne, February 3.

At the present time considerable speculation is rife as to the amount of the bill Italy will have to pay for the earthquake disasters. The provinces of Messina and Reggio were not among the richest of Italy, their total aggregate wealth being com puted at about 1,360,000,000 lire. A probable esti mate of the capital loss caused bv the destruction of buildings is something over a hujndred million lire. The two provinces together, for instance, did not possess 1.1 per cent, of Italy’s consolidated debt. Messina held the 20th and Reggio the 59th place in the scale of funded wealth. But more than half these securities are registered, and so their disappearance means no loss. Furthermore, the State is arranging to apply the value of the lost bearer securities whose ownership cannot be established, together with the property devolving upon the State by the death of all the v heirs of a patrimony to the formation of a fund for the aid of the children orphaned by the disaster. The extra burden can easily be met by slight additional taxation, and all idea of a loan has been scouted from the first. WEATHER FORECAST FOR TODAY of the Royal Saxon Meteorological Institute. Fresh north-westerly winds, overcast, rain at first, snow later, gradual fall of temperature. DIPLOMATS AT LOGGERHEADS. M. Nelidoff, the Russian Ambassador at Paris, recently refused to receive the wife of the Mili tary Attache, Count v. Nostiz, who is an American. Count Nostiz thereupon challenged M. Nelidoff. In case the latter refused the challenge, his son was to fight the duel. Both, however, declined, where upon Count Nostiz struck young Nelidoff.—Count Nostiz has just arrived at St. Petersburg, and it is supposed that the whole affair will go towards ac celerating the change of Ambassadors at Paris.

The Californians, however, according to a con temporary’s New. York correspondent, still maintain that the number of Japanese in the State is steadi ly growing, thousands gaining entrance over the Mexican border in the course of every year, while the official statistics are compiled merely from the arrivals at the ports.

PEHS10H BEHNCKE The matinee hat was bound to reach Russia, and ft has managed to penetrate into the provinces, ac- the St. Petersburg correspondent of a contemporary. The other evening a lady, an officer’s wife, sat in the front row of the parterre of the Novgorod theatre. The lady was wearing a hat which measured fifty-six inches across. Fifteen people craned their necks in a vain attempt to catch even a glimpse of the stage ; in vain they besought the lady to remove the offending hat. At last a police man was called in; he told the lady that she had made herself “a public nuisance,” and he summoned her to appear next morning at the local police-court. She was fined a small sum, and warned against wearing such a jjnonstrous hat, at least in the theatre. AVALANCHE overwhelms a diligence. Berne, February 3. The sleigh diligence from Davos to the Engadine was overwhelmed by an avalanche in the Fluelen Pass. The postilion and guard were rescued, but a road-man is still buried under the snow and it is feared he is lost. There were no passengers in the diligence. THE NEQUS OF ABYSSINIA.

At the present time considerable speculation is rife as to the amount of the bill Italy will have to pay for the earthquake disasters. The provinces of Messina and Reggio were not among the richest of Italy, their total aggregate wealth being com puted at about 1,360,000,000 lire. A probable esti mate of the capital loss caused bv the destruction of buildings is something over a hujndred million lire. The two provinces together, for instance, did not possess 1.1 per cent, of Italy’s consolidated debt. Messina held the 20th and Reggio the 59th place in the scale of funded wealth. But more than half these securities are registered, and so their disappearance means no loss. Furthermore, the State is arranging to apply the value of the lost bearer securities whose ownership cannot be established, together with the property devolving upon the State by the death of all the v heirs of a patrimony to the formation of a fund for the aid of the children orphaned by the disaster. The extra burden can easily be met by slight additional taxation, and all idea of a loan has been scouted from the first. WEATHER FORECAST FOR TODAY of the Royal Saxon Meteorological Institute. Fresh north-westerly winds, overcast, rain at first, snow later, gradual fall of temperature. DIPLOMATS AT LOGGERHEADS. M. Nelidoff, the Russian Ambassador at Paris, recently refused to receive the wife of the Mili tary Attache, Count v. Nostiz, who is an American. Count Nostiz thereupon challenged M. Nelidoff. In case the latter refused the challenge, his son was to fight the duel. Both, however, declined, where upon Count Nostiz struck young Nelidoff.—Count Nostiz has just arrived at St. Petersburg, and it is supposed that the whole affair will go towards ac celerating the change of Ambassadors at Paris.

The following additional details of the Russian police scandals are supplied by a St. Petersburg press correspondent:—Private advices from a good source State that the fugitive agent-provocateur Azeff has gone to Japan, disguised as a French “voyageur de commerce.” The reports of his pre sence in Switzerland are ridiculed here, it beijng held that Azeff would not be so utterly foolish as to seek refuge in a country that is swarming with Revolutionists. A man answering closely to Azeff’s description was recently seen at Vladivostock, vyhich fact lends colour to the story before men tioned. A well-known Socialist told me on Satur day that the fugitive was “doomed beyond all pos sibility of escape.” Nothing could possibly save him. On the eve of M. Lopuchin’s arrest the Minister of Justice gave a soiree. One of the guests tells me that M. Kamyshansky, Procurator of the Court of Appeal, who effected M. Lopuchin’s arrest on the Sunday, was beaming and was telling every body in a highly mysterious fashion that a sensa tional event was about to take place. On the Mon day M. Kamyshansky was received by the Czar, who praised him for his energy, and hinted to him that, should M. Shtcheglovitoff retire, he might expect to receive the portfolio of Minister of Justice. The Russian Press, says the St. Petersburg cor respondent of the Times, recognises that this case is one of the gravest predicaments that have ever befallen Russia. The organ of the Union of the Russian People alone defends Azeff, warning the Government that unless it shields him it wlill dis courage others from rendering services of vital im portance to Russia. BRITISH TRADE IN JANUARY. SEVERE DEPRESSION CONTINUED. London, February 9. Far from exhibiting any signs of that “revival” of trade which has been so long promised by those satisfied with England’s present fiscal system, the Board of Trade returns for January, issued on Sa turday afternoon, can only be compared with the worst of the monthly records of the past year of depression. Again, nearly the whole of a large de crease in British exports is to be attributed to a falling-off in the British sales of manufactured ar ticles ; while a diminution j|n imports once more re presents almost wholly decreased purchases of raw materials. The figures are:— Imports. Exports. January, 1909 £53,511.359 £28,803,046 January, 1908 56,363,379 34,407,767 Decreases ...... £2,852,020 £5,604,721 Nearly two millions of the falling-off in British imports comes under the heading of raw materials. The principal decreases were:— Iron Ore, etc €91,935 Other Metallic Ores 55,041 Wool and Timber 376,625 Cotton 1,213,246 Oil Seeds, Fats, etc 162,290 Materials for Papermaking 39,868 Miscellaneous 55,760 The decrease in imports of manufactured articles amounted to £259,449. This was largely due to decreased purchases of cutlery, wool and silk, ma chinery, chemicals, earthenware and glass, and “mis cellaneous.” In iron, steel, and other metals, elec trical goods, manufactures of wood, cotton, and other materials, except wool and silk apparel, and leather manufactures, British imports increased. Turning to exports, the British public is faced by the disquieting fact that out of the decrease given above, as large a sum as £5,207,878 represents the diminution in the sales of manufactured articles to other countries. There is not one of the seventeen groups of manufactured articles which has not an ominous sign before it in the comparison column. Some of the decreases in this long list are Iron and Steel Manufactures £409,741 Other Metals 136,786 Cutlery 128,596 Machinery 402,264 Ships (new) 262,783 Cotton 2,671,007 Wool 375.401 Other Materials 82,186 Chemicals 145,196 Earthenware and Glass . , 57,595 Miscellaneous 363,966 In these accounts imports for the current'and two previous years are, for the first time, classified as from the countries whence they were consigned, and not front whence they were shipped. There is also a more detailed classification of some of the articles imported, and the countries of their consignment. THE MESSINA EARTHQUAKE. Professor Gregory, lecturing at Glasgow on “The Level of the Sea,” maintained that it had no fixed uniform level. In addition to small changes due to winds and other causes, there were larger dif ferences due to the lateral attraction of the land; while the sinking of the ocean floors and the prob able changes in the form of the earth must have powerful effects in lowering the sea level through out the globe or altering its distribution by the tilting of a large area of the earth’s crust. Of all these agencies, probably the most potent was the alternate deepening and shallowing of the ocean basins, lead ing to an alternate advance and retreat of the sea upon the land. The Mediterranean basin had been formed by such subsidences, and a sudden snap'dur ing the slow foundering of its bed probably caused the appalling tragedy of Messina. KEATS AND BURNS. “I had no conception that the native place of Burns was so beautiful; the idea I had was more desolate; his ‘Rigs of Barley’ seemed always to me but a few strips of green on a cold hill—Oh, pre judice!” So wrote John Keats in « 1818. “It was as rich as Devon.... We went to Kirk Alloway. A prophet is no prophet in his own country! We went to the cottage and took some whisky. I wrote a sonnet for the mere sake of writing some lines under the roof; they are so bad I cannot transcribe them. The man at the cottage was a great bore with his anecdotes. I hate the .rascal. ... he is a mahogany-faced old jackass wfto knew Burns; he ought to be kicked for having spoken to him; the flat dog made me write a flat sonnet One song of Burns is worth more to you than all I could think for a whole year in his native country.” MUSICIANS’ GRIEVANCES. It is not only in London that civilian musicians are complaining of what they term the unfair com petition of military bands. The Federation of French Musicians has presented a petition to Parliament calling upon the Legislature to prevent military bandsmen from taking part in any concerts in fu ture. Two instances of the alleged injustice do not carry conviction with them. In one case a military band has been engaged to play at a concert at Biarritz, and the other grievance is of a similar na ture at Montpelier. The federation ignores the hypo thesis that the soldiers may be the better musicians, and the inference is that the red coat is a sure sign of incapacity. CHURCH SERVICES: DRESDEN.

WHO DISCOVERED AMERICA? if (Continued from page 1.) ever, a small thing compared with the enthusiastic veneration and admiration of generations which has clustered round the name of Columbus. His dis coveries and voyages, next to the Odyssey, form per haps the finest story in the world. Emerson rather severely remarks :— “Strange, that the New World—that broad Ame- “rica—must wear the name of a thief. Amerigo “Vespucci, the pickle-dealer at Seville, who went “out in 1499, a subaltern with Hojeda, and whose “highest naval rank was boatswain’s mate, in an “expedition that never sailed, managed in this lying “world to supplant Columbus, and baptize half “the earth with his own dishonest name.” There is, however, no reason for supposing Vespucci himself connived at the suggestion of the name “America.” At the age of forty-seven he went to sea for the first time, and took part in an expedition to the South American continent, as an inexperienced landsman and not as a sailor at all, the credit of the voyage belonging to whomsoever the critics place in command, Pinzon or Ojeda. In any case, not even to Columbus himself are the honours strictly due of having discovered America. The claims of the Norsemen cannot, in face of all the incontestable and overwhelming evidence in their favour, be ignor ed. Columbus discovered the West Indies, which he thought to be part of Asia; touched the Panama isthmus, and South America near the mouths of the Orinoco,—all this was between 1492 and 1503. Meanwhile the real America in the North was being discovered by John Cabot, accompanied by his son Sebastian, in 1497. This discovery of North America, at the end of the fifteenth century, by Englishmen —the crew were all British sailors—led by a Genoese pilot, under the direct authority of Henry VII., is an important fact in the story of the discovery of the New World, and an event scarcely second in importance to the discovery of the West Indies by Spaniards, led by another and perhaps more distin guished Genoese pilot. The great Dominion of Ca nada, the Crown Colony of Newfoundland, as well as the mighty Republic of the United States of North America,—all the people, in fact, of British origin on the Western Continent, must look to JOHN CABOT as their ‘“Columbus”! (To be concluded tomorrow.) A CORRECTION AND SOME NOTES. (By the writer of the articles.) In the middle of paragraph IV. (CARTOGRAPHY) for Iceland (in yesterday’s issue) read Ireland. This fact is of importance when the condition of Ire land at that time is taken into consideration. Brian Boru was the practical Over-King of Ireland, the Alfred the Great of Ireland, and Scandinavian king doms existed all round the coast; Limerick on the west side being important, and Dublin on the east beittg of great interest as the kingdom (until the Battle of Tara in 979) of Olaf Cuaran, the historic Hamlet, also three times King of York. Ireland had also its traditions of discovery in the New World, and of an Irland it mikla, Great Ireland, in that continent. The news of the shipwrecked mariners would undoubtedly spread, and these rest less sons of the sea went everywhere. Harald Hardrede, already, mentioned as cruising in Davis Straits and Baffin’s Bay, was Chief of the Varangian guard in Constantinople: so the East would hear the story of the newly discovered world. THE VIKINGS IN AMERICA. To the Editor of The Daily Record. In view of the extremely interesting articles you are now publishing on the above subject, I expect you will be interested to read the following para graph from the London Globe:— “The rumoured discovery of an inscription in the United States proving that the Scandinavian sailors or Vikings landed in America in the fourteenth cen tury is so interesting that one naturally hopes it is genuine. There is nothing intrinsically impossible, or even improbable, in such an event. It is well- known that the Scandinavians sailed from Norway to Iceland, and founded flourishing colonies there early in the Middle Ages; that they subsequently proceeded to Greenland, where they again settled permanently; and their own records telj of a fur ther movement forwards, when “Helluland” and “Vinland” were discovered. These two places have been identified variously as Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Maine; few districts, indeed; on the Atlantic coast of North America have not at one time or other put forward a claim to have been discovered by the Northmen. It will be remembered that Long fellow founded his poem of “The Skeleton in Ar mour” on the supposed discovery of the body of a Viking; and a good many American writers have followed his example. More important is the fact that the genuineness of the documents which speak of “Helluland” is not disputed by scholars, and that the voyage from Greenland to the North American coast would present few difficulties to such daring seamen as the Scandinavians.”— A.

As there are many of our readers who still appear to believe that ""letters despatched to America under the hew* - cheap rate—10 pfgs. for 20 grammes, only by steamer sailing from German ports—are not for warded by the express steamers, but are kept back for transference by “any old tub,” we may state that, on the contrary, such letters are despatched by the first steamer on the schedule, be it an ex press or ordinary mail steamer. No distinction what ever is made, and full advantage of the cheaper rate may therefore be taken. Such letters may be sent by every steamer sailing from a German har bour (Hamburg or Bremen) which appears in our daily mail list. ICE IN THE ATLANTIC. OCEAN LINERS IN PERIL. There has never been a year in modern times when ice was so abundant in the North Atlantic as it has been this spring, writes a Newfoundland corres pondent, and already more than a score of steamers have sutfered damage from this cause off the New foundland coast. The Arctic fields are spread over an expanse of ocean stretching beyond the Grand Banks, probably 200 milei wide, and all the move ments of shipping between Europe and the northern portion of the American continent have been seriously incommoded in consequence. The liners plying to and from Montreal have been compelled to make wide detours round the southern ends of the floes, and even the New York liners have been in many cases held up and driven from their courses through the same cause. No one can assign any explanation of why these ice conditions exist in certain years and are not ex- periencd in others. As this is written, the whole eastern seaboard of Newfoundland is absolutely blockaded with the tloes, and from Cape Race right north to the Straits of Belle Isle there is not a marine bottom in motion. The coastal steamers, the fishing schooners, and the hundreds of trawlers that operate on the Grand Banks are all driven to port, and there must remain until a decided and continued change of wind occurs. Not since 1863 has there been such a state pf affairs experienced, and in those days very much less inconvenience was felt from this cause, as the population was smaller and the flotillas were proportionately less, and the busi ness interests did not demand such regular com munication as at present. In the spring of 1890 floes and bergs were very prevalent in the North Atlantic, and a number of marine tragedies resulted which are attributed to this cause. Four stout steamers, with an aggregate personnel of nearly 300, one of two having some passengers aboard, vanished from human ken, and it has always been believed that ice was the cause of their disappearance. In the spring of 1899, again, no fewer than ten freight steamers, with 380 souls, vanished in the same way. All had left different American ports at dates which would bring them together on the Grand Banks, and the theory always has been that they were caught in the floes there, and, a hurricane springing up, were pounded to pieces, so that they leaked apace and speedily went to the bottom with all hands aboard. A Dangerous Situation. The worst feature of this iceberg condition is that all the bergs and floes are now drifting South into the track of New York liners, and as the more ice there is the more fog there will result. The outcome will probably be that during the current summer the peril to steamers on the North Atlantic will be greater than ever, what with fog on the one hand and ice on the other. The bergs, moreover, are of monstrous size, and the larger they are, of course, fhe longer they take to melt, and the further South they are carried before they disappear. There are always during the summer months more or less of these silent destroyers cruising across the ocean lane soqth of the Grand Banks, and this year pro mises tq witness a record number. Until ten years ago accidents to liners from collision with these were very numerous, as then the sailing track of the New York greyhounds traversed the southern end of the Grand Banks, which, owing to the meet ing of the currents, is where most of them are found, and where they are sometimes as thickly strewn as fishing boats. Disasters became so com mon that an International Conference was called, which resulted in shifting the ocean lane nearly 200 miles further south, and this has minimised the fre quency of danger not a little, though from time to time there still occur mishaps which only the superior construction of the modern liner prevent from being terribly disastrous. Last year one of the big German flyers stfuck a b^rg, fortunately without. seriously injuring herself, blit it is rarely that steamers sur vive an encounter with these ice masses, as only one- eighth of the total volume of, the berg appears above water, and its contour below may be very different from that above; so that when a steamer rams it she disturbs its equilibrium, and causes it to topple over, the result being that an unsuspected mass arises beneath the ship’s bottom, and either tears it out or tumbles over the ship, so that all go to bottom together. A ROMANCE OF THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE. Messina, June 17. After the great earthquake in this region, a young priest, a protege of the Archbishop, rescued a young lady of good family from the ruins. The two young people have now sailed for Buenos Ayres, there to be married. WEATHER FORECAST FOR TODAY of the Royal Saxon Meteorological Institute. North-easterly wind, clearing up, dry, warm.

A great snow blizzard is reported to have swept down from the North-West, levelling large num bers of houses and trees and blocking the railways and the highroads with great snowdrifts. It is in tensely cold, and at Kansas City the thermometer fell 50 degrees during the space of six hours. LINER DAMAGED IN THE GALE. Captains of steamers arriving at New York state that the fogs along the Atlantic seaboard have been succeeded by steadily increasing winds and heavy seas. The “Kronprinzessin Cecilie,” of the North German Lloyd Line, arrived off the Hook in a rather battered condition. She experienced unpleasant wea ther all the way from Bremen, but made a good run notwithstanding. On Monday mountainous seas were encountered, and her deck rails were carried away. Her commander estimates that on that day the velocity of the wind was at least 75 miles an hour. IN A NUTSHELL. GREAT BRITAIN AND GERMANY. “His Majesty’s (King Edward’s) definite assur ance that his visit was directed not only to recall to the world a close family relationship, but to assure it of his earnest desire to strengthen the friendly dispositions between the two countries will be every where appreciated. “This object will be best attained by a perfectly frank recognition on both sides of the necessities of each other’s position in the world. The grace ful allusion of the Emperor to the World-Empire of Great Britain suggests in a sentence what must ever be the keynote of British policy. The main tenance of that Empire in its integrity, the protec tion of its enormous ocean-borne commerce, and the safeguarding of the shores of this, its island citadel, connotes a Navy of overwhelming strength, since upon this our national existence depends. In Germany the conditions are to some extent similar, for if her coastline is comparatively small, her land frontiers necessarily need the watchfulness of a great Army, whose size and efficiency can only be an ob ject of admiration to the English people. Nor is there any disposition to deny to Germany the right to such extension of her Naval power as she may deem necessary for her legitimate purposes. It is for our rulers to take care that the advance in the Navies of any great maritime people shall not either singly or together deprive us of our supre macy on the sea. Such, we are persuaded, are the lines upon which the policy of both countries should be conducted, and which we hope and believe the Royal courtesies at Berlin will strengthen and con firm.”— Globe. JACK B1WNS1N LONDON. INTERESTING PRESENTATION TO “C.Q.D.” HERO. London, February 11. 'However weighty may have been the views of Carlyle as to the advisability of hero-wPrship, Mr. Jack Binns, wireless telegraph operator of the “Re public,” holds an opinion contrary to that great authority from the hero’s point of view. After having been almost smothered in the embraces of chorus girls in. New York and deafened with pxans at his native Peterborough, he had to wind-up an interview with some thirty Pressmen at the offices of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company yester day afternoon by making a speech. He blushed when he rose, and he was still blushing when he sat down. Col. Sir C. Euan-Smith welcomed the hero, who, by remaining at his post and flashing the “C.Q.D.” signal for help, saved the lives of the passengers on board the “Republic.” Mr. Marconi said he had had many opportunities of appreciating the value of the company’s wireless telegraph operators, and he had never had any doubt that in a case of peril they would utilise the means at their disposal for obtaining help from other vessels. He congratulated the company on having Jack Binns on its staff, and he congratulated Jack Binns on having been the first to show the world how much wireless telegraphy could do in saving life at sea. The inventor then handed to Mr. Binns a gold watch with the inscription:— “Presented by the Directors of Marconi’s Wire less Telegraph Company to Mr. J. R. Binns, telegraphist-in-charge R.M.S. “Republic” on 26th January, 1909, when in collision with S.S. “Flo rida,” in recognition of the efficient discharge of his duties on that occasion.” Mr. Binns, with much embarrassment, thanked the directors, and said that the gift gave him much pleasure, especially as it came from his employers, fie' hoped he would always be able to do his duty in future (applause).

The Roman journal Messagero laments the three- cornered agreement* with regard to Abyssinia, for it considers that the agreement has resulted in Italy giving up entirely its rights to “peaceful penetration” in favour of England and France. The Messagero draws attention to the very great commercial con cessions and advantages which the recent German commercial missions have succeeded in obtaining from the Negus Menelik, and the journal referred to says that “a very dark future is in store for Erithrea,” the Italian dependency on the coast of the Red Sea; in fact, it calls upon the Italian Government to be on its guard to protect from complete ruin the re mains of Italy’s possessions along the Red Sea,pos sessions which were won at the cost of such terrible sacrifice. The area of Italy’s African dependency is about 88,500 square miles, with about 670 miles of coastline. RULERS OF THE WORLD. Apropos of the birthday of the Kaiser, a Paris contemporary compiled the ages of the principal ru lers. Among those ,whb have passed 50 years of age we find the following:—Francis Joseph, 79 years; Leopold II., 7.4; Charles of Roumania, 70; Edward VII., 67; Frederick VIII., 66; Abdul Hamid and Menelik, 65; George I. of Greece, 64; and Gustav V. and Theodore Roosevelt, 51. In the list of those who .have not reached 50 years • are:— Ferdinand of Bulgaria, 48 years; Victor Emma nuel II. and Nicholas II., 40; Haakon VII. and Ma- homet-Ali-Mirza, Shah of Persia, 37; Mulei Hafid, 36; the Khedive of Egypt, 35; the Queen of Hol land, 29; Alphonse XIII., 23; and Manuel II. of Portugal, 20. The President of the French Repub lic and the Pope are ignored. EAST AND WEST. An amusing story is related by a Paris contem porary of the experiences of M. de Lagrene, who was sent on a diplomatic mission to China in 1844 under Louis Philippe. The Ambassador was staying at Macao, and one morning was brought to him a great roll of paper from 25 to 30 metres in length. What did it contain was the thought that was uppermost with the mission. Was it a con cession? The Chinese interpreter soon set doubts at rest. It was, he explained, the carte-de-visite of the Celestial plenipotentiary. When they had un rolled the missive to the extent of 15 metres, the floor of the hall being well covered, they stopped. In return for this exquisite politeness the French Ambassador was only able to return his modest visiting card. OVERLOOKED. We note what seems to us a flaw in the picture circulated by the London Artists’ Corps satirising the Modern Young Man. He is represented as sitt ing in an arm-chair reading a paper, on which ;.h large letters are the words “Football Results.” That is to say, the football news is on one page of the paper, and he is reading another. What evidence have we that he is not studying an article on Mi litary Tactics? 1 A PRESENTIMENT. The French Consul at Messina, M. de Pommeyrac, who lost his life in the earthquake, seems to have had a presentiment when he left Fiance that he would not return. ’His term of service was running out, and he applied to 1 be appointed, to Florence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, 'in recognition of M. de Pommeyrac’s services, wished to oblige him, but Florence not being vacant, he appointed him to Messina. A friend who congratulated M. de Pom meyrac on the appointment, in wishing him fare well, observed that he ought to be happy. “You have a fine post,” he added. “Without doubt. It is in Italy, and Messina has a splendid climate, but I regret I am not going to Florence. I do not know why, but I have a presentiment that you will never see me again,” was the prophetic res ponse of the departing Consul. MOVEMENTS OF LINERS. NORDDEUTSCHER LLOYD S. S. Co. Dresden office.

From all parts of Germany intense cold is reported, bringing joy to the hearts of winter sport lovers, and distress to the poor. Telegrams received from Paris yesterday were to the same ef fect, cold and frost of extreme intensity. Great Britain has not escaped the cold wave, as the late telegram which appeared in our edition of yesterday plainly showed. In central London on Monday and Tuesday the thermometer registered 27deg., or 5deg. of frost. In more exposed districts it was even colder, and at points during the nights in the south east and south-west localities there were respectively 13deg. and lOdeg. of frost. The first snow of the winter was experienced in England on Monday, and from many parts real blizzards were reported. Rail way traffic has been carried on under great diffi culties ; several trains have been indefinitely held up by the deep snowdrifts, particularly in the nor thern counties and Scotland. The snowfall in Scot land is said to have been the deepest on record, but since we hear the same statement repeated re gularly every year, it is open to question. Aber deen, however, reports drifts in the neighbourhood to depth of eight feet, and that is certainly some what unusual. Local conditions in Dresden and Ber lin are extremely favourable to skating, toboggan ing, and other forms of cold weather sport. If the present frost continues, of which there appears every likelihood, a large portion of the population may be expected to don skates. Low readings of the temperature at uiuereni Continental cities on Tues day W'*re as follow: Stockholm, 7deg., Berlin, 12deg,, Brussels, 13deg., Christiansund, 14deg., Frankfort, 18deg., Munich, 18deg., Paris, 22deg., Nice, 36deg., Rochefort, JSdeg., and Biarritz, 41deg. The closing days of ’he year are rendered noteworthy by the examples we are having of inclement weather and natural phenomena. Violent storms at sea have been followed bv the terrible earthquake in Calabria and Sicily, which, according to latest reports, bids fair to reap a record harvest of victims. It should be remembered that detailed official reports of the catas trophe must necessarily be lacking for some time yet, owing to the interruptions sustained in the tele graphic service, and that consequently the death-roll at Messina, Reggio di Calabria, and other towns and districts vill doubtless be on an even greater scale than appears at present Already the loss of life far exceeds that in the famous Lisbon earthquake in 1775, when 60,000 people were killed; and the comparitvely recent demolition of San Francisco, while perhaps more spectacular, pales into insignifi cance beside the appalling figures to hand from Sicily. * COLLISION AT HAMBURG. Hamburg, December 29. A collision occurred yesterday evening in the Kuh- warder harbour between the English steamer “Dun- das” and the Hamburg-American line’s steamer “Se villa.” The latter ship was badly damaged and four men of her crew were hurt. The “Dundas,” which was also damaged, has left the harbour. THE SITUATION IN VENEZUELA. RIVAL FACTIONS FIGHT. Port of Spain, December 29. A fight has occurred between the respective ad herents of Castro and Gomez. When the crew of the gunboat “Miranda,” who had declared for Ge neral Gomez, endeavoured to land at Macuro, they were prevented by General Torres with 500 men under his leadership. A fight ensued, resulting in 20 men being killed and 50 wounded. VIOLENT WEATHER IN SPAIN. San Sebastian, December 30. Violent storms have done considerable damage in the northern provinces of Spain.

THE DESTRUCTION OF MESSINA. MORE THAN 100,000 DEAD. OTHER CITIES IN RUINS. APPALLING SCENES. The latest despatches to hand from the scenes of the earthquake in Sicily and Calabria show the dis aster to be on an infinitely greater scale than was at first indicated. Conservative reports announce a death-roll of well over 100,000 in Messina and Cala bria alone, while thousands of others must have perished in the numerous towns and villages which also suffered destruction. Appalling scenes are re lated by eye-witnesses of the frightful catastrophe. All Italy is plunged into mourning, and the King and Queen, with their usual sympathetic interest in the misfortunes of their subjects, left Rome for the afflict ed districts immediately upon receipt of the awful news. Details of the disaster are contained in the following telegrams. ' Naples, December 30. The King and Queen arrived here this evening, and were enthusiastically greeted by large crowds. They at once proceeded to the arsenal and boarded the battleship “Vittorio Emanuele,” which immediately left for Messina. Fugitives from Messina who have arrived at Palermo report that the city has been razed to the ground. Out of 160,000 inhabitants, 12,000 at the most have escaped death. Thus 148,000 people in Messina alone have fallen victims to the catastrophe. Only a few buildings are still stand ing, including the facade of the council house, and the Hotel Trinacria, whose interior collapsed at the first shock. The Villa Sanderson, in which, the German Emperor has stayed, has completely dis appeared. As the King of Italy arrived here by special train the Deputy Chimirri approached him and said: “Your Majesty, may your arrival help to calm the affrighted people!” He was sharply inter rupted by the King, who said: “Don’t talk non sense !” Fugitives from Messina give lurid accounts of the disaster which recall the destruction of Pompeii. After the first shock the panic-stricken inhabitants rushed from their houses and fled through the streets under a hail of falling masonry, huge coping stones and marble balconies crashing down upon their heads. A weird moaning came from the sea, which had been lashed into fury by the subterranean disturbances. The streets were knee-deep in water. Heart-rending scenes were wit nessed when fire broke out in many parts of the ruined city. Deeds of heroism were performed by officers, military surgeons, and soldiers Who kept calm amidst the general panic. Eye-witnesses of Reggio’s destruction give the following-account: The city lay wrapped in slumber, when suddenly there came a deafening din like a bombardment from thousands of unseen cannon. Huge tidal waves raced up the beach and overwhelmed the low-lying parts of the city. The roar of whole streets simul taneously collapsing mingled with agonised human shrieks. All this occupied only a few minutes. In Messina 276 prisoners broke out of gaol, looted collapsed buildings and dead bodies, and did their best to hinder the work of rescue. Many of these marauders, caught redhanded, were ruthlessly shot down by troops hurriedly called out to maintain order. Other witnesses of the scenes at Messina report that at one moment the city was seen from the harbour brilliantly lighted, at the next it was plunged into darkness, and a dense cloud of smoke blotted out everything from the eye. The first people to land and start rescue work found every thorough fare leading to the council house blocked by debris, while corpses covered the ground. Fire then broke out at many points. Rome, December 30. Several naval officers who were on board a torpedo- boat lying before Messina when the earthquake oc curred, relate that at 5.30 a.m. the sea was violently agitated, and their vessel trembled from stem to stern. At the same instant an enormous wave was seen to dash upon the shore, capsizing many craft and damaging the seafront. An Austrian steamer was • torn iTuiu her moorings and ran amok among the other shipping, doing great damage. The har bour locks and wharves were destroyed, and the sea was covered with floating wreckage. Blue jackets from the torpedo-boat, assisted by the crew of a British ship, were the first to land and engage in the work of rescue. Escaped criminals were busily at work plundering banks and other places of busi ness. Half the population of Messina was- killed. An army captain who has arrived at Gerace Marina reports the city of Reggio di Calabria to be completely destroyed. The number of dead is appallingly great. English and Russian warships in Messina harbour landed sailors to assist in rescu ing people buried in the ruins, and the ships them selves have been converted into floating hospitals. The prefect of Catanzaro has Vvired for helpers to extricate the countless victims embedded in the ruins of Melito and Lazzaro. Reggio itself is unable to despatch assistance, as the town stands in need of every available man. The' recovery and bufial of the dead bodies at Messina is a matter of urgent necessity if a terrible epidemic is not to break out. Hundreds of soldiers are lying crdshed beneath the fallen buildings at Reggio di Calabria, and practically the whole police force has been wiped out of existence. In Bagnara every house collapsed, killing at least 1,000 people. The prefect of Reggio reports the city to be completely destroyed, and that thousands of people have perished. All public build ings are razed to the ground. Moreover, many districts of the Calabrian province have suffered to a similar extent. Another shock was felt at Palermo on Wednesday evening at 7.30 o’clock, everybody fleeing from the houses into the open. No serious damage is reported from there, how- ever. Travellers who have reached Palermo say that the scenes witnessed at Messina and Reggio utterly beggar description. Reggio, San Giovanni, Scilla, Cannitello and other towns are nothing but smoul dering heaps of ruins. Thousands of corpses are under the debris. The British steamer “Ebro”, has reached Palermo and landed 16 wounded, includ ing Mr. Gaston, the English Consul at M$s$ipa, whose wife was killed, but his daughter escaped injury.

Hamburg, December 29. A collision occurred yesterday evening in the Kuh- warder harbour between the English steamer “Dun- das” and the Hamburg-American line’s steamer “Se villa.” The latter ship was badly damaged and four men of her crew were hurt. The “Dundas,” which was also damaged, has left the harbour. THE SITUATION IN VENEZUELA. RIVAL FACTIONS FIGHT. Port of Spain, December 29. A fight has occurred between the respective ad herents of Castro and Gomez. When the crew of the gunboat “Miranda,” who had declared for Ge neral Gomez, endeavoured to land at Macuro, they were prevented by General Torres with 500 men under his leadership. A fight ensued, resulting in 20 men being killed and 50 wounded. VIOLENT WEATHER IN SPAIN. San Sebastian, December 30. Violent storms have done considerable damage in the northern provinces of Spain.

THE DESTRUCTION OF MESSINA. MORE THAN 100,000 DEAD. OTHER CITIES IN RUINS. APPALLING SCENES. The latest despatches to hand from the scenes of the earthquake in Sicily and Calabria show the dis aster to be on an infinitely greater scale than was at first indicated. Conservative reports announce a death-roll of well over 100,000 in Messina and Cala bria alone, while thousands of others must have perished in the numerous towns and villages which also suffered destruction. Appalling scenes are re lated by eye-witnesses of the frightful catastrophe. All Italy is plunged into mourning, and the King and Queen, with their usual sympathetic interest in the misfortunes of their subjects, left Rome for the afflict ed districts immediately upon receipt of the awful news. Details of the disaster are contained in the following telegrams. ' Naples, December 30. The King and Queen arrived here this evening, and were enthusiastically greeted by large crowds. They at once proceeded to the arsenal and boarded the battleship “Vittorio Emanuele,” which immediately left for Messina. Fugitives from Messina who have arrived at Palermo report that the city has been razed to the ground. Out of 160,000 inhabitants, 12,000 at the most have escaped death. Thus 148,000 people in Messina alone have fallen victims to the catastrophe. Only a few buildings are still stand ing, including the facade of the council house, and the Hotel Trinacria, whose interior collapsed at the first shock. The Villa Sanderson, in which, the German Emperor has stayed, has completely dis appeared. As the King of Italy arrived here by special train the Deputy Chimirri approached him and said: “Your Majesty, may your arrival help to calm the affrighted people!” He was sharply inter rupted by the King, who said: “Don’t talk non sense !” Fugitives from Messina give lurid accounts of the disaster which recall the destruction of Pompeii. After the first shock the panic-stricken inhabitants rushed from their houses and fled through the streets under a hail of falling masonry, huge coping stones and marble balconies crashing down upon their heads. A weird moaning came from the sea, which had been lashed into fury by the subterranean disturbances. The streets were knee-deep in water. Heart-rending scenes were wit nessed when fire broke out in many parts of the ruined city. Deeds of heroism were performed by officers, military surgeons, and soldiers Who kept calm amidst the general panic. Eye-witnesses of Reggio’s destruction give the following-account: The city lay wrapped in slumber, when suddenly there came a deafening din like a bombardment from thousands of unseen cannon. Huge tidal waves raced up the beach and overwhelmed the low-lying parts of the city. The roar of whole streets simul taneously collapsing mingled with agonised human shrieks. All this occupied only a few minutes. In Messina 276 prisoners broke out of gaol, looted collapsed buildings and dead bodies, and did their best to hinder the work of rescue. Many of these marauders, caught redhanded, were ruthlessly shot down by troops hurriedly called out to maintain order. Other witnesses of the scenes at Messina report that at one moment the city was seen from the harbour brilliantly lighted, at the next it was plunged into darkness, and a dense cloud of smoke blotted out everything from the eye.

From all parts of Germany intense cold is reported, bringing joy to the hearts of winter sport lovers, and distress to the poor. Telegrams received from Paris yesterday were to the same ef fect, cold and frost of extreme intensity. Great Britain has not escaped the cold wave, as the late telegram which appeared in our edition of yesterday plainly showed. In central London on Monday and Tuesday the thermometer registered 27deg., or 5deg. of frost. In more exposed districts it was even colder, and at points during the nights in the south east and south-west localities there were respectively 13deg. and lOdeg. of frost. The first snow of the winter was experienced in England on Monday, and from many parts real blizzards were reported. Rail way traffic has been carried on under great diffi culties ; several trains have been indefinitely held up by the deep snowdrifts, particularly in the nor thern counties and Scotland. The snowfall in Scot land is said to have been the deepest on record, but since we hear the same statement repeated re gularly every year, it is open to question. Aber deen, however, reports drifts in the neighbourhood to depth of eight feet, and that is certainly some what unusual. Local conditions in Dresden and Ber lin are extremely favourable to skating, toboggan ing, and other forms of cold weather sport. If the present frost continues, of which there appears every likelihood, a large portion of the population may be expected to don skates. Low readings of the temperature at uiuereni Continental cities on Tues day W'*re as follow: Stockholm, 7deg., Berlin, 12deg,, Brussels, 13deg., Christiansund, 14deg., Frankfort, 18deg., Munich, 18deg., Paris, 22deg., Nice, 36deg., Rochefort, JSdeg., and Biarritz, 41deg.

Other witnesses of the scenes at Messina report that at one moment the city was seen from the harbour brilliantly lighted, at the next it was plunged into darkness, and a dense cloud of smoke blotted out everything from the eye. The first people to land and start rescue work found every thorough fare leading to the council house blocked by debris, while corpses covered the ground. Fire then broke out at many points. Rome, December 30. Several naval officers who were on board a torpedo- boat lying before Messina when the earthquake oc curred, relate that at 5.30 a.m. the sea was violently agitated, and their vessel trembled from stem to stern. At the same instant an enormous wave was seen to dash upon the shore, capsizing many craft and damaging the seafront. An Austrian steamer was • torn iTuiu her moorings and ran amok among the other shipping, doing great damage. The har bour locks and wharves were destroyed, and the sea was covered with floating wreckage. Blue jackets from the torpedo-boat, assisted by the crew of a British ship, were the first to land and engage in the work of rescue. Escaped criminals were busily at work plundering banks and other places of busi ness. Half the population of Messina was- killed. An army captain who has arrived at Gerace Marina reports the city of Reggio di Calabria to be completely destroyed. The number of dead is appallingly great. English and Russian warships in Messina harbour landed sailors to assist in rescu ing people buried in the ruins, and the ships them selves have been converted into floating hospitals. The prefect of Catanzaro has Vvired for helpers to extricate the countless victims embedded in the ruins of Melito and Lazzaro. Reggio itself is unable to despatch assistance, as the town stands in need of every available man. The' recovery and bufial of the dead bodies at Messina is a matter of urgent necessity if a terrible epidemic is not to break out. Hundreds of soldiers are lying crdshed beneath the fallen buildings at Reggio di Calabria, and practically the whole police force has been wiped out of existence. In Bagnara every house collapsed, killing at least 1,000 people. The prefect of Reggio reports the city to be completely destroyed, and that thousands of people have perished. All public build ings are razed to the ground. Moreover, many districts of the Calabrian province have suffered to a similar extent. Another shock was felt at Palermo on Wednesday evening at 7.30 o’clock, everybody fleeing from the houses into the open. No serious damage is reported from there, how- ever. Travellers who have reached Palermo say that the scenes witnessed at Messina and Reggio utterly beggar description. Reggio, San Giovanni, Scilla, Cannitello and other towns are nothing but smoul dering heaps of ruins. Thousands of corpses are under the debris. The British steamer “Ebro”, has reached Palermo and landed 16 wounded, includ ing Mr. Gaston, the English Consul at M$s$ipa, whose wife was killed, but his daughter escaped injury. He gives shocking accounts of the terrible scenes. Rome, December ,30. The King of Italy has donated 200,000 lire ior the relief of the sufferers.

' ","THE DESTRUCTION OF MESSINA. MORE THAN 100,000 DEAD. OTHER CITIES IN RUINS. APPALLING SCENES. The latest despatches to hand from the scenes of the earthquake in Sicily and Calabria show the dis aster to be on an infinitely greater scale than was at first indicated. Conservative reports announce a death-roll of well over 100,000 in Messina and Cala bria alone, while thousands of others must have perished in the numerous towns and villages which also suffered destruction. Appalling scenes are re lated by eye-witnesses of the frightful catastrophe. All Italy is plunged into mourning, and the King and Queen, with their usual sympathetic interest in the misfortunes of their subjects, left Rome for the afflict ed districts immediately upon receipt of the awful news. Details of the disaster are contained in the following telegrams. ' Naples, December 30. The King and Queen arrived here this evening, and were enthusiastically greeted by large crowds. They at once proceeded to the arsenal and boarded the battleship “Vittorio Emanuele,” which immediately left for Messina. Fugitives from Messina who have arrived at Palermo report that the city has been razed to the ground. Out of 160,000 inhabitants, 12,000 at the most have escaped death. Thus 148,000 people in Messina alone have fallen victims to the catastrophe. Only a few buildings are still stand ing, including the facade of the council house, and the Hotel Trinacria, whose interior collapsed at the first shock. The Villa Sanderson, in which, the German Emperor has stayed, has completely dis appeared. As the King of Italy arrived here by special train the Deputy Chimirri approached him and said: “Your Majesty, may your arrival help to calm the affrighted people!” He was sharply inter rupted by the King, who said: “Don’t talk non sense !” Fugitives from Messina give lurid accounts of the disaster which recall the destruction of Pompeii. After the first shock the panic-stricken inhabitants rushed from their houses and fled through the streets under a hail of falling masonry, huge coping stones and marble balconies crashing down upon their heads. A weird moaning came from the sea, which had been lashed into fury by the subterranean disturbances. The streets were knee-deep in water. Heart-rending scenes were wit nessed when fire broke out in many parts of the ruined city. Deeds of heroism were performed by officers, military surgeons, and soldiers Who kept calm amidst the general panic. Eye-witnesses of Reggio’s destruction give the following-account: The city lay wrapped in slumber, when suddenly there came a deafening din like a bombardment from thousands of unseen cannon. Huge tidal waves raced up the beach and overwhelmed the low-lying parts of the city. The roar of whole streets simul taneously collapsing mingled with agonised human shrieks. All this occupied only a few minutes. In Messina 276 prisoners broke out of gaol, looted collapsed buildings and dead bodies, and did their best to hinder the work of rescue. Many of these marauders, caught redhanded, were ruthlessly shot down by troops hurriedly called out to maintain order.

Ambassador and Mrs. David Jayne Hill left the Hotel Adlon on Monday to take up quarters at their private residence, Bismarck Strasse 4, Char- lottenburg. Mr. A. Ker-Clark, 3rd Secretary of the British Em bassy, left last week for England, whither he was suddenly summoned by news of the illness of his sister, Miss Clark, who died on Christmas Day. Mr. Clark was about to leave to spend the holi days at Ober-Ammergau. Miss Clark was known in Berlin, having spent last winter here when she took part in Court and leading Society functions. The English Church of S. George, Monbijou Garten, was crowded as early as eleven o’clock on Christmas Day. So heavy was the claim upon the pews that the members of the British Embassy pre sent gave up the Embassy sittings to the congrega tion, and themselves occupied .the Royal pew. An impressive Christmas Service was held. The Church was effectively decorated with a large Chancel screen, covered with fir and # holly, and surmounted by a large cross of white flowers. Palms and foliage stood on each side of the altar, while on the superaltar were placed vases of red and white flowers. The Chaplain preached an appropriate Christmas sermon on the custom of giving at Christmas, dwell ing especially upon the strong hold which this cus tom has obtained among the German people. The magnificent rendering by Mr. van Eweyk of a Re citative and Aria from “The Messiah” greatly added to the impressiveness of the service. Mr. van Eweyk’s voice seems especially adapted to Oratorio work. On the Sunday following Christmas Day carols were sung at the close of the evening service at S. George’s: “Noel,” “See amid the winter snow,” and “Good Christian Men, Rejoice” being given. On the previous Sunday evening the same carols were sung, together with “Good King Wenceslas,” the solos being taken by Miss Wortley and Mr. F. D. Carpenter. The Rev. Mr. Paterson, who was recently called to England by news of the death of his mother, is expected to return to Berlin at the beginning of next week. He will resume his Assyriological studies here, and will again render assistance to the Chaplain in the services at S. George’s. A further donation ,of books has been made to the library of the American Church, the gift, which is from Mrs. J. F. Dickie, being intended on this occasion to serve as the nucleus of a German addition to the library. Mrs. Dickie contributes:— Goethe, 8 vols. Schiller, 8 vols. Heine, 4 vols. The German addition to the Library is to be com memorative of Frau Dr. Hempel. Frl. Else Klemm, and Frl. Rosa Franke have also donated German books. Gifts of German works from others willing to help will be cordially appreciated. A sqcred concert will be given in the American Church on Sunday evening, January 3. Among those participating are: Miss Frances Rose, of the Berlin Royal Opera (Soprano), Kirk Towns, Lessing, 3 vols. Uhland, 2 vols. Tieck, 2 vols. of the Wiesbaden Opera (Baritone), and George Walter, the well known Bach tenor of Germany. A silver collection will b£ taken at the door for the benefit of the music fund. Friends of Mrs. George F. Daniels, and Miss Mabel W. Daniels, well known in the American Co lony last year as guests at Pension van Heuckelum, will regret to hear of the death of Mr. Daniels, which occurred suddenly on December 1 at his home at Brookline, Mass. Mr. Daniels was about to com plete the tenth year of his presidency of the Handel- Haydn Society at Boston. The organisation had gain ed greatly in prosperity and prestige under his ef ficient leadership. A memorial service to Mr. Daniels, whose loss will be greatly felt in musical and art circles in Boston, was held by the Handel-Havdn Society on December 27. Miss Daniels is known in Berlin as a promising young composer and author of the “American Girl in Munich,” a brightly written music-student’s diary, a copy of which is on the shelves of the library of the American Chuch. Miss Norah Drewett, of Keith Strasse 19, 'well known in Anglo-American musical circles here, has sent Christmas greetings to Berlin friends from Vienna, where she expects to make her permanent home. Mr. and Mrs. Adolf Weidig, of Aschafrenburger Strasse 6, joined by Miss Mabel Woodworth, Miss Olive Woodward, Miss Mabel Krog, and Miss Eleanor Gunzerhausen, will leave Berlin on January 4 for a short holiday to Dresden and Leipzig. Mr. Weidig, who is well known here as a violin teacher and composer from Chicago, had a Christmas tree reunion of his pupils on Christmas night. The reception recently given by Madame Kirsinger, Kurfiirstendamm 242, in honour of Mrs. Dean B. Mason, of Paris, proved an unusually brilliant affair, especially looked upon in the light of a musical event. Joan Manen, the celebrated Spanish violin virtuoso, rendered a fine programme with his usual wonderful brilliancy—though he did not play upon the famous Sarasate violin presented to the late mas ter by the Queen of Spain. Man£n opened with the Kreutzer Sonata. Later, compositions of his own were rendered, three small Works, and a piano quartette. Ill the last-named a surprise was in store for many, inasmuch as Manen came to the front as a pianist, while the violin was played by another artist, M. Sambino, a Belgian. Manen’s pianistic performance called forth the greatest admiration, especially in view of the versa tility it evidenced in the renowned violinist. The other artists were M. Beloussow (’cello) and Herr Schuch (viola). Of the two hundred guests who attended, about one third were Americans. Many Spanish were pre sent, in honour of Senor Manen. Mrs. Dean Mason, the guest of honour socially, was gowned in pink and looked charming. Elaborate buffet refreshments were served in a room festooned with Christmas decorations.

It is gratifying to learn that a sum of 7,700 marks was cleared as a result of the ice festival on the Carola See last Saturday week, arranged /by the third and fourth sections of the local Johannes Verein. Thanks to the auspicious weather and the keen in terest exhibited by the public, the festival was at tended by at least than 5,600 people. The temporary buffets erected and stocked by the generosity of Ver ein members and others interested did a roaring trade, and sold out all their comestibles within a few hours of the commencement. From this source alone 2,000 marks were netted, and generously hand ed over to thje Verein by Herr Freitag, the pro prietor of the restaurant. Frau Kommerzienrat Reichel and Count Wilding gave an entertainment for the members of the Verein on the lake at Moritz- burg. On Saturday last, at the Kiinstlerhaus, a meet ing of the committee of the Dresdner Gesellschaft fur neuere Philologie took place, with H.R.H. Prince Johann Georg in the chair. In the course of the meeting the plans for the next ^series of literary lectures by Mr. Powys and the dramatic represen tations of tjje French troupe Roubaud were dis cussed. The skating rink in the Waldpark at Weisser Hirsch is momentarily adorned by a group of polar bears, finely modelled in snow by Herr Brodauf, the well-known artist. This highly perishable but striking work of art is admired by crowds of spec tators daily, and has been frequently photographed since its completion. It is greatly to be hoped that a radical change in the weather will not make its untimely appearance, and so destroy this really re markable example of artistic ingenuity. j The very heavy snowfall which has covered nor them Europe commenced on Saturday, and our re ports state that navigation was thereby rendered exceedingly difficult on the North Sea. At times the gusts came with the velocity of a blizzard. The weather conditions promise well for lovers of win ter sports in the vicinity of Dresden, but they would be greatly improved by the touch of keen frost which is lacking as we write. As it te the snow is very much of a nuisance, since its insidious pene trative properties make light of the stoutest foot gear, and the meaningless prejudice against rubbers, DEATH OF MADAME DE LESSEPS. Paris, February 1. Madame de Lesseps, widow of the renowned French canal engineer, died yesterday at the age of 58. CALIFORNIA AND THE JAPANESE. San Francisco, February 1. The Bill providing that foreigners shall- not be allowed to acquire State territory comes up in the State Legislature today for further discussion. Go vernor Gillett states that the Bill does not contain any clause conflicting with the treaties which have been concluded with Japan. Sacramento, February 1. The Governor has published Mr. Roosevelt’s last letter, in which the President says he has no ob jection to make to a law prohibiting the acquisition of land by foreigners, provided that it is made applicable to all foreigners alike. But, in order to avoid a conflict with the State constitution, the Kill should contain an express stipulation excepting from the operation of the law all rights that have been granted to foreign nations by the United States.

American visitors to England and the Continent are at loss to under stand the popular aversion to these particularly use ful articles, which become an actual necessity when a rapid thaw converts the streets into canals of chilling slush. Apropos of this subject, we think that the rapidity with which the snow is disappearing from the Dres den thoroughfares before the efforts of d large army of sweepers reflects the greatest credit on the municipal authorities. They are ‘very properly tak ing advantage of the lack of frost, which renders the task of cleaning very much .easier than if the snow had become caked by a fall in the temperature.

Since November 1904, i.e. for more than four years, a law-suit has been in progress between the firm of Ludwig Hupfeld, of Leipzig, manufacturers of the Phonola piano-player, and the Aeolian Company, of New York, who are responsible for the Pianola player. This prolonged suit was terminated on Sa turday last, when the Supreme Court at Leipzig gave judgment in favour of the German company. As a result of this decree, the American firm is power less to interfere with the manufacture and exploita tion of the Phonola, which nearly resembles the Pianola . instrument. The guards in the city today are furnished by the Schiitzen regiment No. 108, whose band plays about 12.30 p.m. in the Neustadt. MUSIC AND ART NOTICES. In honour of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, the original cast of that composer’s head, taken after death, is exhibited in the window of the Hofmusikalien- handlung F.

When the conflagration broke out the beautiful craft were crowded by holi day-makers, and a terrible panic at once occurred.

The King s Birthday Dinner held last night at the Hotel Adlon by the British Colony in Berlin was the most brilliant function which has yet taken place in the not-too-eventful annals of English life here. The function will go on record as the first attempt ever made by his subjects in Berlin to celebrate, collectively and appropriately, the birthday of his Majesty King Edward. About three hundred and fifty attended. Particular satisfaction was felt at the fact that the staff of the British Embassy made a point of joining heartily in the Colony’s loyal celebration. Sir Edward Goschen himself was absent from Berlin 5“!L W ? S re P resented by Count de Salis, the Charge’ d Affaires, accompanied by the entire Embassy Stan. The members of the Embassy present included — Colonel Trench, the Military Attache, and Mrs. Trench ; Mrs. H. L. Heath, wife of the Naval Attache, and Miss Heath; Mr. R. S. Seymour, First Secretary ; a f o and Lady A & nes Durham ; Mr. Monk, and Mr. Sampson. Captain Heath, the British Naval Attache, is out of Berlin and was hence unable to be present. In former years the British Ambassador and re presentatives of the Embassy have, on the King’s Birth day, invariably attended a special German celebra tion of King Edward’s Birthday in the shape of a dinner organised by the “King’s Regiment” in Berlin It is gratifying to think that, thanks to the well directed and untiring efforts of the British Colony Committee, a worthy English celebration should at last have become a possibility in this city ^health of King Edward was proposed by Count de Salis, Charge d’Affaires, while Professor Delmer, u iH reS l dent tJle CoIon y Committee, proposed the health of the German Emperor. Three ladies of the English Colony constituted a Reception Committee to welcome the guests: Mrs. J. W. Louth, wife of one of the oldest English re sidents m Berlin; Mrs. A. F. P. Hayman, wife of the Churchwarden of S. George’s; and Mrs. J. A. Ford, wife of the Hon. Secretary of the Colony Com mittee. (Further details in a later issue.) Ueut. Commander R. R. Belknap* the able and po pular American naval attache stationed in Berlin, has consented to deliver a lecture in the American Church on Tuesday evening, November 23, dealing with his experiences in Reggio and Messina in directing the American relief-work in the devastated Italian cities. The lecture will be illustrated by from 60 to 100 lantern-slides. This represents a rare opportunity to hear at first hand the striking story of the grand work done by America, under the direction of Lieut.-Commander Belknap, to aid earthquake-stricken Italy. We regret to record the death last Thursday, at * c. Furstenhof > Berlin, of Mr. Albert MacGill, of Scotland, the wealthy proprietor of a factory in Moscow. Mr. MacGill had been suffering for se veral! weeks, since arriving in Berlin, with a com plication of diseases. Hope of his recovery had for some time been abandoned. Mr. MacGill, as pre viously stated, was the brother-in-law of Mrs. Georg Kuhn, of Berlin (nee Miss Rose Gibson), whose sister he married. A funeral service was held at S. George’s Church on Saturday afternoon, Rev. J. H. Fry officiating, remains were sent to Hamburg for cremation. i- ^ ev * ^ r * D H. Murlin will be absent from Ber lin this week, spending a few days in the Harz Moun tains with friends, Pastor Rohrbach, of Charlotten- burg, will take his place at the mid-week Prayer Meeting in the American Church this afternoon. Pastor Rohrbach is one of the best-known per sonalities of Charlottenburg, and is almost as Eng lish as he is German thanks to his frequent inter- «>urse England, and to the fact that Frau I astor Rohrbach is an Englishwoman. Mr. Arthur van Eweyk, an American singer well known in Berlin, was the soloist last Sunday in the Garmson Kirche, when Mozart’s “Creation” was given at a special musical service to celebrate the restoration of the famous historical Church after its destruction oy tire.

I fear that if the Reichstag accepts the proposed legislation it will disturb the relations existing between Germany and America, for I cannot look at the measure as anything else than a device to invalidate formal engagements by parlia mentary act and to take from Americans advantages which they have gained through legitimate contracts or investments. The government affirms that its pro posed action has the object only of preserving an important national resource and of preventing the sale at ruinous prices of a portion of the national fortune-a pretext that has no sufficient basis in view of the immense deposits of potash, which are estimated to be enough to last centuries. It is scarcely to be believed that the industrial influences in the Reichstag will allow as a matter of principle such an interference as that proposed in private business. Such legisla tion might be the beginning of expropriation by the ^ e , other businesses as, for example, mining ” Telegrams from Washington in New York news papers indicate that the United States Government has taken note of the reported intention of the German government to legislate against the filling of Ameri can potash contracts made during the temporary dis solution of the potash syndicate.

NEW YORK, Tuesday —A terrible explosion oc- curred in a Brooklyn comb factory yesterday after noon. Rescue work was at once commenced and by evening nine bodies had been recovered from the debris. Several other people are still missing. Cabled advices from New York state that Tammany Chief Murphy is sulking in the wigwam. Various statements in explanation of the electoral defeat have been ascribed to him, but his friends declare that he has not said a word for publication. He will not be pleased with the statement attributed to Judge Gaynor, Tammany’s successful candidate for Mayor, that it is a good thing for the city that thie Fusionists have obtained control of the Board of Estimate. This is thought to indicate that the new Mayor will carry on his administration in friendly accord with the reformers, in which event Tammany will, indeed, be in a parlous condition for the next few years. . Som'e of the Tammany leaders say that the reverse is due to over confidence on the part of their men but this does not fit in with the fact that all the local leaders reported that they had polled every one of the electors for whom each was responsible, and more. The victory of the anti-Tammany forces was clearly due to a great rally of the various sec-i tions, and to the vigilance displayed by them through-* out polling day, which prevented duplicate voting on anything like a large scale. Ex-Boss ‘Croker, who is on a visit there, thinks that Tammany will find consolation in defeat, and ultimately reappear as strong as ever. Beyond a few words to this effect, and a reaffirmation that he is definitely out of politics, he has said nothing. ’ LONDON, Tuesday.—Sir Robert Hart, former In spector General of Chinese Customs, announces that he may resume that office in the spring of next year. (From our correspondent) ,NEW YORK, Oct. 18. —During President Taft’s recent visit to Los Angelos a decently dressed working man entered the police headquarters in that city and asked the sergeant on duty to lock him up. The astonished sergeant en quired what crime the man had committed. The work man, labouring under visible embarrassment, said that his name was Czolgocz. For a moment the sergeant was speechless, but recovering himself he asked his visitor to stay where he was. During the whole day that President Taft remained at San Francisco, Czol gocz was detained at the Los Angeles police station. He is known to be an industrious and respectable man, but it is his misfortune to be the bearer of a name universally execrated owing to his brother’s assassination of President McKinley. SYDNEY, Tuesday.—Following on the strike of miners in the collieries of Newcastle and Maitland, the entire police force is being held in readiness. The railway administration has taken possession of all coal supplies in goods trains and on board ship In the retail trade the price of coal has already in creased by 100 jrer cent. SYDNEY, Tuesday.—It is reported from Newcastle that commerce is at a standstill. The striking miners have formed a committee to fix rules for the con-, duct of the strike. One hundred coal trains, which usually run every day, are side-tracked. The mine owners are holding back £20,000 which they owe in wages to the strikers, and it is doubtful whether payment will be immediately made. The difficulty of the strikers is their lack of funds.

The caretaker with his wife and five children escaped by throwing themselves from the windows. The woman was badly injured, but the children es caped with slight hurt. Eleven firemen and three other persons were severely injured. It is believed that matches left lying in the auditorium by the audience caused the fire. Nine houses in the vicinity of the theatre were damaged. Three hundred artists and their families who were employed in the theatre are without means of subsistence. MADRID, Tuesday.—At a banquet of 110 covers given last night, King Alfonso and the King of Por tugal exchanged hearty toasts, both referring to the traditional friendship between Spain and Portugal and the prosperity of their two countries. ^ MELILLA, Tuesday.—The military operations in the Riff are now regarded as being at an end. The envoys of Muley Hafid have again counselled the Beni Sika tribesmen to respect the proposals of the Spaniards. FLORENCE, Monday.—An automobile conveying the King of Italy and his aide-de-camp collided on the Pisa road with a careless cyclist, a boy aged twelve years. The boy was hurled a considerable distance and remained unconscious for several mi nutes, while, the King and his aide-de-camp attended to him. He soon recovered consciousness and it was found that he was not badly hurt.

Today witnesses the opening of the new Session of the English Parliament, a Session which, it is universally expected, will prove more exciting from a political point of view than any preceding one in the history of the present Administration. Great issues are at stake, and the Cabinet is therefore preparing for the fight on a measure consistent with the expected opposition to their designs. It is pro posed, once and for all, to end or mend the House of Lords, that bogey which persistently looms large on the Liberal horizon. We have heard much of the Government’s intention to go to the country on this issue, but such language has of late been not ably conspicuous. The truth is that the electorate refuses to view the Lords as the hateful anachro nism they appear to militant Liberals. The Upper House is too old an institution for a people with the deep-rooted conservative instincts of England to cast forth at a word, particularly when that word emanates from parties distinctly interested in its sum mary removal. Experienced prophets are already dar ing to predict that the Upper House will pass un scathed through the coming fight—or, at least, will come out on top. The weak point in the Govern ment’s plea is the fact that the Lords have thrown out just those Bills which aroused heated opposi tion from the middle classes,—the Education Bill and the Licensing Bill, and in this it is fairly cer tain that they enjoyed the support of a popular majority. The indictment against the Upper House which, it is believed, is in course of preparation by the Cabinet, must necessarily be backed by theo retical arguments rather than concrete instances of misbehaviour. There is also the danger that by fero ciously attacking this venerable institution, the Libe rals will lay themselves open to the charge of re volutionary tendencies, even a hint of which would suffice to lose them numberless votes from the con firmed monarchical electors of the middle and lower classes. The Navy is another snag on which the Govern ment is not at all unlikely to split in this Session. Rarely have Naval Estimates been awaited with such keen expectation as those for the current fiscal year. There have been many indications of heart-search ing in the Cabinet relative to these Estimates. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is quaking for his Bud get, already known to be hampered with a serious deficit, and is therefore naturally against lavish out lay on the Fleet. On the other hand, the Opposi tion—and, it is believed, a large number of Liberal members—are united in their demand that the Navy be handsomely provided for this year. They claim that the Government, by its experimental and costly legislation in social matters, such as Old Age Pen sions, has got itself into a deep financial hole, and is now inclined to extricate itself by means of the Navy, which would certainly suffer during the pro cess. Another difficulty facing the “little-Navyites” are the repeated Ministerial pledges given on behalf of the Fleet; these cannot be repudiated, and if they are skilfully dodged the country will demand the reason. If Mr. Asquith succeeds in piloting his unwieldy craft through the shoals of the present Session he will earn the reputation of a phenomenally gifted party leader. The difficulties are appalling, while the resources, in spite of the Government’s vast majority, are pitifully inadequate. With report ed disunion in the Cabinet, open rebellion amongst the Government’s Irish, Labour, and Socialist sup porters, and at least two serious conflicts looming ahead, the Prime Minister will need all his legal diplomacy and masterful determination to steer a straight course from today. MORE EARTHQUAKES IN SOUTHERN ITALY. Rome, February 14. A very violent undulating earthquake shock, last ing several seconds, was felt in Reggio di Calabria at 20 minutes past 8 o’clock yesterday evening. The people rushed out of their huts in alarm, but no damage is reported. A similar shock, lasting about six seconds, was felt in Messina at the same time, terrifying the people, but not otherwise harmful. Brancaleone, February 14. A very violent earthquake occurred here at 8.32 p.m. yesterday, causing the people to rush out of their dwellings into the open air. SPECIAL NOTICE!

It is officially announced that Admiral Lord Charles Beresford will relinquish command of the Channel Fleet on March 24th next. His retirement will in augurate a complete rearrangement of the British naval forces in home waters. All the latest and most powerful ships of the Channel Fleet will be assigned to the Second (Nore) Division of the Home Fleet, retaining their original crews, based on Sheerness. This official announcement thus sub stantially confirms the Daily Mail’s report on the 12th inst., according to wlhich all British commis sioned warships in home waters will be assembled under the copimand of 4 Admiral Sir William May, who will have 150 fighting units under his orders. The Daily News learns that nothing has been definitely settled with regard to the naval ship building programme for the current year, as the Cabinet’s decision was held over until after King Edward’s return from his Berlin visit. The journal believes that iii y some respects the Cahinet has aban doned its fornrer altitude towards the naval pro gramme, and from"" economical motives will only sanction the construction of four “Dreadnoughts” for the current fiscal year. If this supposition is correct, it would appear that Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston Churchill have succeeded in bringing their Cabinet colleagues over to their point of view, as it is known that a few days ago a majority was in favour of making generous provision for the Navy this year. MAXIM GORKI TO BE ARRESTED. St. Petersburg, February 14. A warrant has been issued for the apprehension of Maxim Gorki. He is described in the warrant as a house-broker, of Nijninovgorod. FATAL MINE ACCIDENT. FriedrichshUtte, February 14. Last night, owing to dampness, part of the fram ing In a gallery in the Friedensgrube mine collapsed just as a relief gang arrived at the spot, and seven men were buried. The accident was discovered later by an inspector who was going his rounds, and the work of rescue began at once. Up to 9 o’clock this morning the bodies of two hewers and two haulers had been recovered; and it is probable that the clearing away of the debris will be completed today. THE ROYAL VISIT TO BERLIN. PRINCE B0LOW ON THE RESULTS, London, February 14. The German Imperial Chancellor, Prince Biilow, according to the Berlin correspondent of Reuter’s Bureau, expresses himself very hopefully with re gard to the results of the Royal visit to Berlin, and has made the following declaration: “The trend of the conversations between British and German statesmen has also created sincere satis faction on the German side, and established the probability that through the visit of his Majesty the King mutual trust and loyalty will characterise the political aims of both Empires. The negotiations relative to the Balkan question have revealed a ge nerous understanding between the two countries, and also that the maintenance of peace is the guiding policy of Great Britain and Germany. Both Go vernments are similarly at one in their attitude to wards the flew regime in Turkey. Prince Btilow hopes that public opinion in both countries will be guided by the example set by their Sovereigns and statesmen of honourable, peaceful aims, based upon a sincere and mutual understanding.” Berlin, February 14. Newspaper reports to the contrary, it is certain that the inability of Count Stolberg, President of the Reichstag, to attend the banquet in honour of King Edward was due to a sudden case of illness in the Count’s family. This unfortunate event hap pened just at the last moment, so that there was no time to issue an invitation to the Count’s re presentative. On the other hand, all the members of the Reichstag presidency, the presidency of the “Herrenhaus” and Chamber of Deputies, besides a number of deputies representing various Parliamen tary parties were invited to attend the State ball. (From our own correspondent) London, February 14. King Edward and Queen Alexandra arrived at Vic toria Station yesterday evening shortly before six o’clock. A large and distinguished number of people had gathered on the platform to welcome their Ma jesties, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith,; the Foreign Secre tary, Sir Edward Grey, and other notabilities. Great crowds gathered along the short route from the station to Buckingham Palace and heartily cheered their Majesties. It was remarked at the station that both the King and Queen looked well, and apparently none the worse for their boisterous Channel cross ing. An official announcement just made states that the King is greatly gratified as a result of the Berlin visit, and that his Majesty bore the return journey quite satisfactorily. He finds himself in decidedly better health than wihen he started the journey to Berlin. His Majesty caught a slight chill while in the German capital, and the raw weather which the Royal visitors experienced on the Continent rendered precautionary measures ad visable. His Majesty’s health is now, however, com pletely re-established. The Queen is also thorough ly well. An influential weekly review, The Outlook, com menting upon the return of the King, has the fol lowing to say: “It is at last possible to speak hopefully of Anglo-German relations. A step has been taken which removes one of the greatest ob stacles to their improvement. We refer, of course, to the 'Franco-German agreement in regard to Mo rocco. In itself it is a comparatively small matter; but in its implications it is of the first moment. So long as France and Germany were at odds over Morocco it was impossible for us, who had made friendship with France the basis of our European policy, to be on terms of cordiality with Germany. .. .The essence of the new Franco-German compact is that Germany renounces all political ambitions ffi Morocco and confines herself to the peaceful rivalries of commerce. The status quo as it ex isted before Mukden is restored, and the Shereefian Empire ceases to be a bone of contention between Paris and Berlin.” ‘(Continued on page 2.)

No. 887. □ BERLIN ♦s Mr. Sidney Whitman, the English publicist, is making one of his periodical visits to Berlin, and is at the Hotel Continental. Mr. George Ade, the American humorist and play wright, of “Fables” and “College Widow” fame, was on Tuesday night the guest at dinner and the theatre of Messrs. Frederick William Wile and A. C. Wilkiie, former colleagues on the staff of the Chicago Record. Mr. Ade left Berlin on Thursday to continue his tour around the world. Mrs. F. Sefton Delmer, wife of Professor Delmer, of Berlin University, leaves Berlin on January 31 on an extended visit, with her children, to her home in Melbourne, Australia. Mrs. Delmer will return to Berlin about next October. Mr. G. Valentine Williams has returned from a holiday visit to England. The American Woman’s Club held its annual gene ral meeting for the election of officers and committees last Wednesday morning. Much useful work was done. The morning’s proceedings opened with sk somewhat amusing incident when it was discovered by one of the ladies in attendance, Miss Maynard Butler, that under the Club’s Constitution no resolutions could be passed by the present meeting, since only fourteen • ladies were in attendance, while the num ber required to complete the Club quorum was twen ty. There was a certain amount of protest at this excessively parliamentary attitude, but Miss Butler carried her point, and energetic use of the Club tele phone finally brought a number of additional mem bers on the scene. Mrs. A. M. Thackara, President of the Club, an nounced that she had formally put before Mrs. David Jayne Hill, the wife of the Ambassador, the sugges tion that she, Mrs. Hill, should fill the position of Honorary President of the American Woman’s Club during her residence in Berlin. Mrs. Thackara then read a letter in which Mrs. Hill declined the courtesy tendered with cordial thanks. Mrs. Thackara was subsequently re-elected Presi dent, while the 1st and 2nd Vice-Presidents, Miss Molt and Mrs. J. P. Wisser, were also re-elected. A Committee has been formed to discuss arrange ments for holding a reception in honour of Mrs. David Jayne Hill. An important change was made in the Club Con stitution in the course of the meeting. The amend ment now voted makes it possible for foreign-born women who have become American citizens to be members of the Club. Thanks to the energetic and efficient work of Mrs. William C. Dreher, Chairman of the Nominating Com mittee, the vacant post of Recording Secretary, re garding which some anxiety had been felt, has now been filled. Mrs. Dreher has induced Miss Worfolk to undertake this onerous office. It is felt that no better choice could have been made in the interests of the Club. Years ago, prior to Mrs. Honan’s term of office, Miss Worfolk acted for some time in the capacity of Recording Secretary. Miss Amy Hare, the distinguished English pianist who is to give a recital to-night at the American Wo man’s Club for the benefit of that institution, will be heard in orchestral concerts during March and April, in Berlin, Munich, Dresden, and Leipzig. Miss Hare has a list of phenomenally eulogistic criticisms to show from American and English journals. The Washington Daily Post says: “It would hardly be going far enough to say that Miss Hare is a fine pianiste. Her execution is marvellous, and the pre cision that governs her every touch is wonderful. The Liszt “Rhapsodic Hongroise” has probably never before been played in Washington in such magnifi cent manner.” The London Standard speaks of Miss Hare as a “brilliant and powerful executant.” The Bonn-Zeitung says:—“The lady is a perfect mas ter of her instrument. The chief feature of her play ing, hjowever, does not lie in her virtuosity, but purely and entirely in her heartfelt conception of the music. In this conception lies such a mine of sympathetic power as is rarely possessed by feminine humanity. The English may well be proud of such a pianiste.” Sundays: Fridays: Holy Days: CHURCH SERVICES: BERLIN. S. George’s Church, Monbijou Garten.

Milanowitsch, the Servian Minister for For eign Affairs, has informed the Austrian Ambassa dor in answer to his representations that his (the Minister’s) speech in the Skuptchina had no aggres sive tendency towards Austria-Hungary. He re gretted that his remarks on the Servian standpoint in the Bosnian question should have caused an im pression in Austria-Hungary that, he entertained feel ings of hostility to the Monarchy. He disapproved of the criticisms uttered by other speakers in the Skuptchina on the internal affairs of the Monarchy, as they were opposed to international usage. THE SYDNEY NAVAL DISASTER. MANY ACTS OF HEROISM. Sydney, January 7. The following details of the naval disaster at Sydney, already reported, have now transpired: About sixty men under Lieut. Dinwiddy, of the “En counter,” embarked at 6.30 a.m. on the pinnace which was towed by a naval steam launch, on board of which were the officers and a large party of Ma rines. The boats were connected by a sixty-foot towline. Near Macquarie’s Point the collier “Dun- more” was seen approaching. The launch towing the pinnace cleared the “Dunmore’s” bows. There were loud cries of “Cut the towline,” but the men in the pinnace saw the danger too late. Their frantic efforts to cut the rope failed, the pinnace was com pletely turned over, and the steamer passed on over the struggling crowd of 60 men, encumbered by their uniforms, belts, and water bottles. The cata strophe was immediately observed from the war ships. Within four minutes boats arrived on the scene. Despite strenuous efforts, however, it was found impossible to save all the men. Some must have been struck by the “Dunmore” and rendered insensible, while others were probably sucked down by the collier’s propeller as she forged past. Some men were saved iby the launch, and some by the “Dunmore’s” boat, while a number seized the col lier’s whaling piece and were helped on board. One sailor swam ashore. A notable feature of the ac cident was the way in which the men helped each other in the water, and many acts of heroism were performed. Four boats from warships with diving apparatus were promptly despatched. Body after body was brought to the surface. The police also dragged the harbour outside the range of the divers. Each corpse, as it was recovered, was wrapped in the Union Jack and placed under an awning on the “Encounter’s” deck, afterwards being removed to a improvised morgue on Garden Island, where sen tries with reversed arms kept guard. The last body was found at 5.30. The captain of the “Dunmore” says he blew his syren and slowed down his engines. Instead of keeping astern, the launch crossed his bow. (Continued on page 3.) ","V.

An esteemed American correspondent, to whom we have frequently been indebted for interesting information, has lately written us from Paris to the following effect :-“In connection with your re- cent article entitled ‘The Land of Divorces,’ you fail to give the statistics of other and older countries. This is unfair because, if you did that the position of the United States would not be’ so bad, comparatively, as most Europeans think. Apparently you purpose it to discredit America, its president and institutions as much as pos sible without appearing unfriendly, and I am sorry for that position because I believe the Daily Record could do a great deal to cement and pro mote a better conception of our country (America) among Europeans.” Criticism from an enemy may we 1 be ignored, because it is usually inspired by malicious motives. Critiqism from a friend, how ever, such as we regard the writer of the above com munication, is something entirely different. We duly appreciate the compliment he pays our organ in his concluding sentence, and we hasten to assure our correspondent, and indeed every American reader of the Daily Record, that far from the policy of our paper being unfriendly towards America and her institutions, it is framed with a vi/ew to avoiding the slightest injury to the susceptibilities of a people so largely represented in Dresden and Berlin, and who, consequently, form a most important section of our readers. Is it not obvious that by adopting an anti-American policy we should be taking the surest means to injure our own interests ? As a mat ter of fact, ever since this newspaper was established its relations with its numerous American readers have been of the most cordial description, and we have frequently been honoured by proofs of con fidence vouchsafed to us by prominent Americans who subscribe to the Daily Record. It may be as well to state that all telegrams published which relate to American affairs come direct to us from the telegraphic bureau to which we subscribe, and that the notes on current topics in America are sent to us by our New York correspondent, who is him- s elf an American. Furthermore, the editorial staff of the Daily Record includes an American colleague. These few facts are, in our opinion, sufficient to clear us absolutely of the charge of anti-American tendencies, and we commend them to our numerous American readers in the knowledge that we shall be accorded fair play. In justice to the correspondent we have quoted above it is necessary to publish his further remarks it 5 f^rence to the question of divorces in the • n ~tates. He says:—“You will find that divorces in the United States have decreased during the last fi ve years, and that those of England have increased during the last five years. Again, the United States have a smaller percentage of insane, of suicides, of paupers than any European country; and that ^ r ; n / the last thirty or forty years the average f life in the United States has gone up to thirty- Europe ” rS * Wh ‘ Ch ^ higher than the average of H.

London, January 8. Speaking last night at a meeting of the electors at Gullane, East Lothian, the Secretary of State for k p ^ a l dane ,’ al,uded to the ^ars expressed by Earl Roberts of a possible invasion of Great Bri tain by a German army 200,000 strong, and said that including the reserves, England possessed a regular army of 320,000 men which was better train ed than any other army. Four divisions could be mobilised within a short time, and there were im mediately weapons, provisions, and men sufficient for mobilising six divisions and more. Including her territorial army, England had 527,000 men in readi ness to repel invasion; he was therefore in nowise anxious as to the defence of the country. THE LOST AERONAUTS. THE GERMAN EMPEROR.

Dr. Richard Strauss has been invited to conduct the perfor mances of “Salome” and the “Symphonia domestica.” Herr v. Schuch will have musical charge of the first per formance of “Elektra,” and will also conduct “Feuersnot.” At this evening’s performance of “Tannhauser,” the title-rdle will be in the hands of Herr v. Bary and Frau Wittich will sing Elisabeth. At the Royal Theatre, Neustadt, “Wallensteins Tod” will be given this evening, beginning at 6 o’clock. The next performance of the Christmas fairy play “Schnee- witchen at this theatre will take place tomorrow after noon. Tickets may be bought in advance today without extra fee; the prices are on a reduced seale. That the English are an unmusical people is continually dwelt on in the press, and this in spite of the fact that there is probably better oratorio singing in England than in any other country in the world. Still, the fact remains that opera is the crown of music, as drama is the crown of poetry, and the absence of any really national opera remains a serious blot on British culture. That the purely English-speaking public are ready to patronise such opera as they can understand was proved by the winter season of Wagner in English which the Covent Garden manage ment undertook last year. It is pleasant to know that, according to a London evening paper, this experiment is to be repeated, and that the direction is again to be in Herr Richter s hands. Last week brought the announce ment of another enterprise, in which the moving spirit is Mr. Charles Manners, whose services to English opera it is impossible to overestimate. Some eighteen months ago Mr. Manners established a National English Opera Union, which he hoped would attain a membership of ten thousand. That figure has not been reached, but the fairly respectable total of three thousand names has been enrolled, and Mr. Manners feels that he is now able to make a further move. He now announces a three weeks season at Drury Lane next May, subject, of course, to sufficient backing from the Union in the matter of sub scriptions for seats. It is Mr. Manners’ intention to pro duce the new operas, all in English, which, as he very justly remarks, are quite certain to obtain production abroad. It is' to be hoped that all lovers of English music will rally to the support of Mr. Manners in his endeavour. ——j—— The international Photographic Exhibition, Dresden 1909. One of the special attractions of this Exhibilion will be a room reserved for photographs taken by Royal and Princely amateurs. King Friedrich August, the patron of the Exhibition, and their Royal Highnesses Prince Johann Georg and Princess Mathiide of Saxony were the first to offer for exhibition photographs taken by themselves. The Queen of Holland, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Germany, the Archduchess Maria Josepha, the Duchess Feodora of Schleswig Holstein, Pqnce Wilhelm of Hohenzollern, Prince Carl of Hohenzollern, the Duchess Carl Feodora of Bavaria, Princess Clara of Bavaria, and Prince Albert of Monaco, have also promised contributions. Prince Albert of Monaco, whose scientific explorations are world-famed, will send some large panoramas of the Polar regions, and a number of autochrome pictures, all done by himself. $ All the automatic telephone boxes at the Hauptbahnhof and the principal telegraph office in Munich were broken open and robbed on Thursday last.

Tannhauser, the minstrel, has been sojourning in the unholy Venus- berg, but prompted by a longing for a holier life he determines to leave the goddess. Her endeavours to restrain him are in vain and he returns to his old home. Here he is discovered by the Landgraf Hermann and his old companions. Entreated by them to rejoin their ranks, he at first refuses, but he yields to the* entreaties of his great friend, Wolfram, who tells him that the Landgraf’s niece Elizabeth still loves him. A great contest of song takes place at which, aftet other singers have sung in praise of ideal, pure love, Tannhauser extols the sensuous passion he has enjoyed in the Venusberg. The others in their horror are about to kill him, but at Elizabeth’s entreaties his life is spared and he, moved to repentance by the devotion of the maiden, determines to join a band of pilgrims proceeding to Rome and seek absolution from the Pope. As the time draws near for the return of the pilgrims, Elizabeth prays fervently for him and refuses to be comforted by Wolfram, when they return without him. Tann- hiuser does come back and relates to Wolfram how the Pope had cursed him and foretold that he would never be forgiven until his pilgrim's staff burst into green leaves. Tannhauser declares his intention of returning to the Venusberg, but the dead body of Elizabeth is brought in, and with a cry to her to pray for him he falls lifeless at her feet, while his staff is seen to be covered with green leaves.

The King’s customary offering of gold, frankin cense, and myrrh, in celebration of the Feast of the Epiphany, was tendered at a special service in the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, yesterday. The service was conducted by the Sub-Dean of the Chapel Royal (the Rev. Canon Sheppard, D.D.), and the priest- in-ordinary-in-waiting (the Rev. T. R. Hine Haycock), four priests in ordinary, and two deputy priests were also in attendance. The children of the Chapel Royal in their scarlet and gold dress lent a pic turesque touch of colour to the service. Following the Apostle’s Creed, the two gentlemen ushers in attendance, Mr. Percy Armytage and Mr, Thomas Kingsoote, presented His Majesty’s offering to the Sub-Dean, the three symbols being enclosed in a hag of crimson silk ornamented with gold, which reposed on a gold alms dish. There was a fairly large congregation at the service, and most of them remained for administration of the Holy Com munion. Following the usual custom the gold will be distributed by the Sub-Dean among a number of Royal pensioners. ENGLISH BANK AMALGAMATION. The secret of the amalgamation of the London Joint Stock Bank with the York City and County Banking Company was unusually well kept, writes the Globe. For some days rumours of an early fusion of important banking interests had been circulating in the City, but it was not until the contents of an official notice, sent out by the London Joint Stock Bank on Tuesday, became known, that the identity of the two institutions concerned was revealed. In the City the reputation of the London Joint Stock Bank, with deposit and current accounts aggregat ing £19,211,000, stands deservedly high; while in the provinces where it is represented the York City and County Bank is regarded as a powerful factor in the domain of finance. That it exerts .a wide influence in the Northern counties is apparent from the fact that its deposit and current accounts amount to £11,596,000, and that it has no fewer than 116 branches and 71 sub-branches. Shareholders in the York City Bank will receive three shares of the London Joint Stock Bank for every ten shares they hold, and a cash payment of 10s. for each share. Amalgamation seems to be the order of the day in the financial, industrial, and mining world. BRITISH TROOPS FOR EGYPT. London January 7.

The King’s customary offering of gold, frankin cense, and myrrh, in celebration of the Feast of the Epiphany, was tendered at a special service in the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, yesterday. The service was conducted by the Sub-Dean of the Chapel Royal (the Rev. Canon Sheppard, D.D.), and the priest- in-ordinary-in-waiting (the Rev. T. R. Hine Haycock), four priests in ordinary, and two deputy priests were also in attendance. The children of the Chapel Royal in their scarlet and gold dress lent a pic turesque touch of colour to the service. Following the Apostle’s Creed, the two gentlemen ushers in attendance, Mr. Percy Armytage and Mr, Thomas Kingsoote, presented His Majesty’s offering to the Sub-Dean, the three symbols being enclosed in a hag of crimson silk ornamented with gold, which reposed on a gold alms dish. There was a fairly large congregation at the service, and most of them remained for administration of the Holy Com munion. Following the usual custom the gold will be distributed by the Sub-Dean among a number of Royal pensioners. ENGLISH BANK AMALGAMATION.

THE CHILDREN’S CHARTER. AN EXPERT’S EVIDENCE. An inviolate Sabbath is an ideal to which a large majority of the Anglo-Saxon race cling with un- diminished enthusiasm, and nowhere does the Puri tanical element invoke the aid of the law in this respect with more persistence than in the United States. Our American readers are aware that theatric al performances are strictly prohibited by the law of New York, but that sacred concerts are permitted. This qualification is fully taken advantage of by enterprising and unscrupulous caterers to the pub lic amusement, and in many instances it is possible to witness performances in the New York theatres on Sunday, the only difference being that the actors appear in ordinary costume and without a scenical background. Many theatre managers, indeed, stretch the la|w to unheard-of lengths, and the sequel is to be found in the police-courts on Monday, when they are summoned for transgressing the statutes of the State. Our New York correspondent sends us in this connection the following amusing article, dated March 30:— The proprietors of the American Music Hall vere summoned yesterday at the police-court for infringing certain clauses of the Sunday law on she previous day, and to show cause why their license should not be cancelled. The point at issue was whether a certain number on the programme constituted a dialogue, as argued by the defendants, * >r an actual vaudeville “turn,” as contested by the police. The “turn” was described on the pro gramme as a “kissing scene.” If it should prove 10 be a dialogue the case for the prosecution must I all through, as recitative entertainments are per mitted by the law. The music-hall proprietors based their defence on the argument that the “kissing scene” at issue really came under the meaning of the act, and in support of this contention they called as a witness Mr. B. A. Myers, who was facetiously described as an “osculatory expert.” After eloquently reviewing his 14 years’ experience as a vaudeville agent, Mr. Myers emphatically as serted that the impugned kissing scene, in which two artists took part, was certainly a dialogue. The following amusing repartee then ensued between Mr. Danzig, prosecuting attorney, and the witness:— Question.—“You know what a kiss is?” Answer.—“Why, naturally.” Q.—“You have observed how others kiss, and have yourself kissed?” A.—“1 have been guilty of it.” Q.—“You are speaking as an expert?” A.—“Yes; that is to say, as a vaudeville expert.” Q.—“Speaking as such, you assert that the kiss- mg-scene in question is actually a dialogue and nothing else?” A.—“Certainly; before you get a kiss you must ask for it.” At this juncture the prosecuting attorney reminded the witness that there were several kinds of kiss ing, and he wanted to know what particular kind of a kiss was given and received in this dialogue. What is the longest period occupied in giving and receiving a kiss which has come before your notice up to the present?” asjked Mr. Danzig. The witness considered a moment and then said that he had observed kissing as done by Mary Gar den in Charpentier’s piece “Louise,” the kiss of ^ophie Brandt in the “Waltz Dream,” and the “soul hiss” of Mdme. Genee. Finally he told of a kiss i which to his kilowledge had lasted a minute and I ^ half. “Was that kiss accompanied by speech ?” politely enquired the attorney. “That would have been impossible,” answered the witness with con- v 'C;ion. “According to your own words, then,” ex claimed Mr. Danzig with pardonable triumph, “a kissing-scene cannot rank as a dialogue. A dialogue connotes speech!” I At this stage the discomfited vaudeville proprie tors asked for an adjournment of the case in order ’hat they might call further witnesses. The pro ceedings were accordingly set down for next week, ?icl we have yet to receive enlightenment on this ait ‘resting point. BERLIN “THE ABSENT MINDED BEGGAR.” An English Congregational minister, lecturing re- ctr’tly on Mr. Rudyard Kipling, stated that one day ' ^ he was seated with Mr. Kipling in his garden p Rottingdean, a street organ struck up “The Ab- ^'t-Minded Beggar,” and that Mr. Kipling re marked: “If it was not suicide, I would kill the pan who wrote that.” The statement was brought to the notice of Mr, f ii n? b y a correspondent, who has received the I allowing reply:— ■ “I do not remember making the remark in ques- 1 '°n any more than I remember the Rev. J. C. Harris. lttef VVr0 * e ‘The Absent-Minded Beggar’ in order to a? much money as I could for some men whom I]. r<;s R ec ted and admired, and I am not, and I never dn tecn « in the least ash amed of what I ’have 1 ° ne » nor of the manner in which I did it.” Professor Felix Adler, late Roosevelt professor to Berlin, who with his family left Berlin on Wednesday for Wies baden, will possibly lecture in Frankfort-on-Main and one or two other cities before finally leaving Germany, the subject proposed being the relations between Germany and America. Contrary to previous reports, Professor Adler expects to deliver no further lectures in Berlin. After a stay of about four weeks in Wiesbaden, Dr. and Mrs. Adler with their family will leave for Italy, returning to Berlin for a few days in June to get final medical advice regarding Miss Margaret Adler’s health before sail ing for America. The English Circle ’ of the Lyceum Club gave a most attractive, “tea” on Wednesday in honour of Lady Edward Goschen, wife of the British Amsassador, who is Honor ary President of the circle. Miss Partello and Fraulein von Scholer, as Vice-Presidents of the English Circle, did the honours of the occasion as joint hostesses. This was Lady Edward s first visit to the Lyceum Club, and she seemed to be most appreciative regarding the artistic Club rooms and their general air of elegance com bined with comfort. Her extended visit, during which she made the acquaintance of many of the English and German members of the Club, terminated with an inspec tion of the remaining Club-rooms, apart from the salons under the guidance of Mrs. Robert-Tornow. Mrs. David Jayne Hill, wife of the American Ambassador, was also present, likewise making her first visit to the Lyceum Club. A high-class musical programme had been provided, with Professor Heinrich Grunfeld, the celebrated cellist, as’lead ing musician. His playing, naturally, left nothing to be desired.

HOW IT WORKS IN LONDON. jThe great test day of the Children’s Act was uni- versally fixed for Saturday by those who know the poorer districts of London. A London, newspaper commissioned a lady expert in social reform to make a tour of certain districts and to report on what she saw. Her report is as follows: — Thousands of London’s children, for practically the first time in their lives, on Saturday spent the day without making acquaintance with the inside of a public house. The Children Act came into force on Thursday of last week, but it was not till Saturday that the effect of the restriction against children entering public houses could really be gauged. I made a tour covering ten miles of the chief roads running through Harringay, Wood Green, Tottenham, and Edmonton, and throughout the jour ney found three public houses only without a group wf women and children outside. In many cases the children were unaccompanied, the mother having join ed the father inside, leaving instructions to the luckless offspring not to stray. In other instances women with children in arms congregated outside the public houses, with other children around them, clinking their glasses and re viling the Act that had caused this alteration in their method of passing Saturday night. Wherever one went, one found the pavement in front of public houses blocked by perambulator, go-cart, or sugar- box on wheels, containing infants who the law says shall never enter a public house till they have at tained the age of fourteen. In many cases women accompanied by children protested against the new regulations, which they evidently had not anticipat ed, and of which they had no knowledge. Some women treated the matter good-humouredly, how ever, these being mostly the wives of the more respectable artisans, who usually spend Saturday evening marketing with their husbands, and whose custom it is to drink one glass together when the purchases are completed. It is the children of women of the lower classes who will benefit most by the Act, women whose habit it is undoubtedly to spend all the time possible in a public house, and whose children take their first walking lessons on sawdust-strewn floor. Directly the child can toddle it will be left in charge of one a little older, as was done on Saturday night by those who were “lucky” enough, as they put it, to have their children out of hand. And unless the Act is 'to be reduced to a farce, this leaving of children of tender years outside a public house for long periods will have to be checked. In the summer it would be bad enough, but on a night like Saturday it was brutal in the extreme. It was pitiable to see some of the poor (little mites standing outside the public houses, shivering under the keen, cold wind. From the children’s point of view, the Act, at present, seems a disad vantageous piece of legislation. Their parents are not going willingly to break through a life-long habit. The law sayjs they shall not take their chil dren inside a public house. Very well, say the pa rents, we will leave them outside. The immediate result to the children is that they have exchanged light and warmth for darkness and cold. They do not know how much better for them it is not to go inside. They know nothing of the moral side of the question—they know only that they are bitter ly cold. In Clause 12, Part II., of the Children Act it is laid dowfr thjat any person who wilfully ill- treats, neglects, or exposes any child, or causes it to be ill-treated, etc., in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering, shall be guilty of a mis demeanour. This would seem sufficient; to put a check on the careless parent, but much depends on the construction placed on the word “wilful.” The remedy lies with the police, who can prefer charges of obstruction against those who, while observing the letter of the Act, deliberately defy its intention THE NORTH GERMAN LLOYD LINE. EFFECT OF RATE WAR. When the Court of Directors and Managers of the North German Lloyd met at Bremen last week to confirm the balance sheet and the profit and loss account of the company for the year 1908, it Was pointed out that the business for 1908 had been affected unfavourably by the unusually steady and probably unprecedented falling off in the number of emigrants to the United States, and by the great depression in the freight market which had been rendered more acute by the rate wars which had broken out between several lines. In spite of the strictest economy the traffic receipts had been so small that it had been found necessary to draw upon the entire reserve and the renewal funds in order to carry out the necessary writing off opera tions. After the closing of the accounts for 1908 the working surplus amounted to 9,218,000 marks as against 32,697,000 in the previous year. The report of the North German Lloyd Company on the unsatisfactory state of its shipping trade in 1908 has had a depressing effect in German industrial circles. ","s. Robert-Tornow.

The Italian despatches we publish this morning unmistakably indicate the severity of the earthquake shock which visited certain districts of Calabria and Sicily in the early hours of Monday morning. Owing to the breakdown of practically all com munication between the capital and the centres visited by the shock, it is quite impossible at this date to accurately, or even approximately, estimate the actual loss in life and property caused by this latest disastrous phenomenon, but each succeeding despatch announces a heavier death-roll. That this grupsome list will considerably exceed one thousand is now a practical certainty. Ancient Messina, be loved of tourists, has apparently suffered more heavily than its neighbours, one of our telegrams announcing the greater part of the city to be de stroyed. The fine Gothic cathedral, which is a prominent landmark, has sustained damage, though to what extent is not yet known. Beautifully si tuated on the slope and at the foot of the Sicilian hills which rise like an amphitheatre above it, its dazzling white buildings thrown into relief by the (fark forests in the background, Messina has justly earned the name of being one of Europe’s most charming cities. But like many other places upon which Nature has lavished her richest treasures, Medina has suffered frequently from her wrath! Tinie and again the city has been visited by earth quakes, but the latest appears to be as disastrous, if pot more so, than any previous disturbance. Calabria, whence come reports of widespread de struction, is another sufferer from these visitations, several of which caused panic among the inhabitants last spring. With the lurid memory of the scenes at Naples a year or two ago still fresh, when Vesu vius vomited fire and destruction on the surrounding villages, public sympathy will go out to the un fortunate people involved in this latest catastrophe. It is pleasing to note that the British and Russian warships in those waters have been promptly des patched to render what aid is possible to the af flicted victims, and that the Italian Government has lost no time in placing a considerable sum at the disposal of the authorities for the purpose of al leviating distress among those deprived of food and shelter. GRAVE SITUATION IN PERSIA. Teheran, December 28. Reuter reports that the situation gives rise to some uneasiness. Many of the bazaars are closed, and the patrols in the streets have been consider ably strengthened. The news from the provinces is unfavourable; the nationalist movement is gaining ground in Asterabad, and has been started afresh in Mesched. At Rescht more than 100 Russian shop keepers have taken refuge at their Consulate. The Governor threatens to have them arrested. On the whole the state of affairs is rather serious. FLOODS IN PANAMA. Panama, December 28. The river Reventazon and its tributaries have over flowed their banks, and the damage done by the floods is considerable. In the Costa Rica district 25 people were drowned. THE EARTHQUAKE IK ITALV. DESTRUCTION OF MESSINA. MANY HUNDREDS OF LIVES LOST. Rome, December 29. The earthquake shock which visited many districts of Calabria yesterday morning and caused extensive damage and loss of life, was also felt in different districts of Sicily, especially in Caltanisetta and Mineo, where panic broke out among the affrighted population. Yesterday evening the streets and squares were rilled with terriffed people camping out for the night. It is reported from Catania, where the shocks lasted some twenty seconds, that a tidal wave immediately afterwards broke along the shore and devastated a great portion of the town. In Noto, where the shocks were experienced for thirty seconds, an attempt was made by prisoners in the town gaol to break out, and it became necessary to call out troops for the purpose of restoring order. Reports of damage are also to hand from Linguag- lossa and Santa Severina, but details are still lack ing. In all the districts visited by the disturbances a large number of buildings collapsed, so that it is feared later reports will reveal very heavy ca sualties. From Calabrian centres comes the news that three people were killed and sixty injured in Stefanaconi; many of the injured are still buried in the ruins, and so far have not been extricated from their perilous plight. The garrison of Majerato has been ordered to assist in the work of fescue. Two people were killed in San Gregor. Signor Giolitti, the Prime Minister, has despatched two officials to report on the damage caused by the earthquake, and has sanctioned the expenditure of 20,000 lire to alleviate pressing distress. Rome, December 29. Telegrams to hand from Sicily announce that the violent earthquake shock caused huge tidal waves all round the coast, and at Catania many vessels foundered, while others were driven ashore and badly damaged. Merchandise awaiting shipment on the wharves was swept away. The shock lasted 32 seconds at Palermo. With the exception of the cable between Naples and Messina, all communica tion with Sicily is interrupted. Railway traffic throughout the island is at a standstill. 'Further advices received at the Ministry of the Interior * more ^ serious light on the damage done at Messina, whither troops have been sent to assist in rescue work. The tunnel near Rometta, on the Messina-Palermo line, has been closed by debris, and the station buildings at Rometta are in ruin9. Reports from .Reggio di Calabria are very disturb ing. A huge tidal wave at Catania swept three children into the sea, capsized and sunk four small vessels, and hurled many others on the rocks. From the provinces come reports of heavy losses in life and property. Two churches at Maletto were de stroyed, together with 55 houses; in Belpasso two houses collapsed, and others were badly damaged; at San Giovanni, near Giarre, ten houses fell in, killing one person. The cathedral at Riposto suf! fered severely from the shock, the entire roof fall ing in; the council house and other public build ings are in danger of collapse. The tidal wave at this point reached a height of thirty feet, over whelmed many buildings and killed or injured several persons. The Minister of Public Works, Signor Bartolini, travelled to Calabria this evening, and will also v »r; Sicily. The Minister of Marine has ordered tUST battleships “Regina Elena,” “Vittorio Emanuele,” and “Napoli” to Messina to organise the work of rescue there and to establish telegraphic communi cation. Further reports from Messina just to hand indicate that a portion of the city has been com pletely destroyed. Large numbers of people were killed and wounded by the collapsing houses. Five steamers have left Catania to convey provisions and help to the distressed population. Reggio di Calabria is completely isolated in consequence of the breakdown of railway and telegraphic com munication. The neighbouring villages reporl many killed and injured. Rome, December 29 (later). A telegram received at the Marine Ministry from the commander of a torpedo-boat announces that Messina has been devastated by the shock. Hun dreds of houses are destroyed. Several hundred people perished at Palmi, and the town itself suf fered heavily. Reggio di Calabria, according to latest despatches, has suffered in life and property almost as badly as Messina. Rome, December 29. The latest news from Messina is that .a great part of the city has been demolished. In Several quarters outbreaks of fire occurred, greatly adding to the horror of the scene. Several thousand people have been killed in Messina alone. A Palermo despatch states that railway communi cation between Catania and Messina has been re established. A trainload of refugees and injured has arrived at Catania from Messina. They reporl the destruction of the Hotel Trinacria, and the death of 90 guests. Immense tidal waves are said to have swept the city, and the damage done will be much greater than at first thought. Doctors arid soldiers have left Palermo to render assistance at Messina. The council house, bourse, post-office, and barracks have collapsed. Syracuse, December 29. The British squadron lying at anchor before Syra cuse, and the Russian warships at Augusta, have received orders to proceed to Messina and render whatever help is possible. Bremen, December 29. The North German Lloyd steamer “Therapie,” bound to the Levant, took on board at Messina the Germans who were there and a number of other passengers, and conveyed them to Naples. Palermo, December 29. A torpedo boat has landed at Milazzo 60 people in jured by the earthquake at Messina. A number of vessels have left Catania for Messina* to render assistance; the deputies Carnazza and Defilice were on board one of them. At Diedimonte many people and injured. In Giarro there were four killed, in Riposte three, in Torre 11 killed and 35 injured, in Fiumefreddo two killed. „ Rome, December 29. The first wireless telegrams confirm the terrible news from Messina. Th6 villages round Messina were also destroyed. The Prime Minister has sent 1.00,000 francs to the Prefect of Naples for a re lief expedition to Messina and Reggio.

GRAVE SITUATION IN PERSIA. Teheran, December 28. Reuter reports that the situation gives rise to some uneasiness. Many of the bazaars are closed, and the patrols in the streets have been consider ably strengthened. The news from the provinces is unfavourable; the nationalist movement is gaining ground in Asterabad, and has been started afresh in Mesched. At Rescht more than 100 Russian shop keepers have taken refuge at their Consulate. The Governor threatens to have them arrested. On the whole the state of affairs is rather serious. FLOODS IN PANAMA. Panama, December 28. The river Reventazon and its tributaries have over flowed their banks, and the damage done by the floods is considerable. In the Costa Rica district 25 people were drowned.

Yesterday evening the streets and squares were rilled with terriffed people camping out for the night. It is reported from Catania, where the shocks lasted some twenty seconds, that a tidal wave immediately afterwards broke along the shore and devastated a great portion of the town. In Noto, where the shocks were experienced for thirty seconds, an attempt was made by prisoners in the town gaol to break out, and it became necessary to call out troops for the purpose of restoring order. Reports of damage are also to hand from Linguag- lossa and Santa Severina, but details are still lack ing. In all the districts visited by the disturbances a large number of buildings collapsed, so that it is feared later reports will reveal very heavy ca sualties.

Further reports from Messina just to hand indicate that a portion of the city has been com pletely destroyed. Large numbers of people were killed and wounded by the collapsing houses. Five steamers have left Catania to convey provisions and help to the distressed population. Reggio di Calabria is completely isolated in consequence of the breakdown of railway and telegraphic com munication. The neighbouring villages reporl many killed and injured. Rome, December 29 (later). A telegram received at the Marine Ministry from the commander of a torpedo-boat announces that Messina has been devastated by the shock. Hun dreds of houses are destroyed.

Several thousand people have been killed in Messina alone. A Palermo despatch states that railway communi cation between Catania and Messina has been re established. A trainload of refugees and injured has arrived at Catania from Messina. They reporl the destruction of the Hotel Trinacria, and the death of 90 guests.
